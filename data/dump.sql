Commissioned as a terminus for railway lines running to the Midlands, construction of the station began in 1864 and was completed by October 1868. The station was designed by the civil engineer William Henry Barlow (1812-1902). Construction of the Midland Grand Hotel adjacent to the station (1865-1873) followed an architectural competition won by George Gilbert Scott. Both the hotel and the train station speak to the emergence of an increasingly mobile Victorian society. Scott was the most successful architect of the Victorian gothic-revival school. Inspired by the high gothic French style, he had studied gothic cathedrals and parochial churches, the influence of which can be seen on some of his other most remarkable designs, including the Albert Memorial and the church of St. Giles Camberwell. Indeed, the Albert Memorial and the Midland Grand Hotel both evidence the Victorian love of colour in their architecture. The hotel at St Pancras station is a magnificent piece of gothic-revival architecture with pointed arches, ribbed stone vaults of pointed profile, and flying buttresses. The station suffered and survived the first two world wars, although it was seriously damaged by enemy action in 1941. A greater threat to its survival came in 1966, when a proposal to demolish both St. Pancras and King’s Cross stations was presented by British Rail. Public opposition ensured its survival thanks to its national value and architectural importance. More recently both station and hotel have been restored to their former glory and the station is now a terminus for national trains running both north and south of London, as well as international trains serving destinations in Europe. St Pancras was a saint whose name meant the one that holds everything, something which well reflects the enormous practical and communal value that the station bearing his name holds today.','2017-12-04 09:10:42','2017-12-04 09:10:42','st-pancras-station'),(29,'Octavia Hill Southwark Cottages','Red Cross Cottages and Garden are among the finest surviving examples of steps taken in the nineteenth century by the so-called ‘five per cent philanthropists’ to alleviate poor quality and overcrowded housing for the working classes in London. Designed by Elijah Hoole, the cottages incorporated Octavia Hill’s love of “quaint irregularity” in their Tudor-influenced design. Octavia Hill was a tireless reformer who believed in a holistic approach to the problems facing many of London’s Victorian poor; to her moral reform and education went hand in hand with housing reform. Hill employed workers to visit tenants in her properties in order to help with home improvement, cleaning and financial management; for example, one non-negotiable aspect of life for Hill’s tenants was the weekly rent demand. The cottages were built between 1884 and 1887 on land given to Hill by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and her philosophy of housing reform is reflected in the design of these cottages. On the site is a small garden for the residents and a hall which became the community’s focus and served as a meeting place for a working man’s club, a band and an army cadet corps. Southwark Council paid for the re-installation of a bandstand in 2014, the paving of which is now engraved with the motivational message ‘Do noble deeds, not dream them’, which was Hill’s motto. While cottages of this type and on this scale could not solve the issues of overcrowding in Victorian London, they did influence subsequent practice and changed the lives of those fortunate enough to call them home.','2017-12-17 18:42:17','2017-12-17 18:42:17','octavia-hill-southwark-cottages'),(30,'East London establishments','Notable central East London establishments','2018-01-12 14:41:40','2018-01-12 14:41:40','east-london-establishments'),(31,'test 1','test 1 ','2018-01-18 12:18:13','2018-01-18 12:18:13','test-1');

By 1901 Albert and his elder brother Henry had become solicitors’ clerks, but by the time the War came he was Secretary of the British Socialist Party in Maiden Lane, Strand, London.   He had married his wife Julia on Christmas Eve 1910 and their first home was in Castlewood Road, Upper Clapton.\n\nAlbert and his wife, Julia, in 1926\n\nHe was living at No.16 Stapleton Hall Road, Stroud Green in 1916.   At first he was exempted from military service on medical grounds following a medical ordered by Hornsey Tribunal in July 1916. However, a year later he appeared before Hornsey Tribunal again and applied for absolute exemption, a further medical having found him to be BIII (just fit enough to fight). This time his application was dismissed, the Chair, Alderman Sloper, having determined that his motivation was political and so could not be conscientious. Albert challenged this ruling at Middlesex Tribunal on 5th July 1917 with the words: “Socialism covers the whole range of moral, religious and political concepts. Its fundamental principle is the international solidarity of the people of all countries… The moral obligation it imposes on the individual are as fully binding as those imposed by the acceptance of religious doctrines or beliefs.” His appeal was turned down.\n\nAt present we do not know what happened to Albert following Middlesex Tribunal’s dismissal of his appeal and during the rest of the war. I should love to hear from anyone who does know. However, we know a lot more about his subsequent life.   He became Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain and was imprisoned at least twice for ‘political’ offences, ‘like publishing and distributing printed matter’.   His comrades in prison included other well-known figures of the Left: Harry Pollitt, Willie Gallacher and Walter Hannington.\n\nAlbert died relatively young – in Edmonton, at the age of 59.\n','',NULL,'2017-02-09 11:31:04','2017-02-09 11:31:04',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(55,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-09 14:37:39','2017-02-09 14:49:06',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Fire Bell Gate.jpg'),(56,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-09 16:28:26','2017-02-09 16:34:15',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Eastbury House.jpg'),(57,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-09 16:39:50','2017-02-09 16:39:50',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Eastbury House 2.jpg'),(58,21,'','This was where any man living or working in the Borough of Hornsey and wishing to claim exemption from conscription, for any reason, could apply to the local Military Service Tribunal after March 1916.','',NULL,'2017-02-11 14:46:50','2017-06-13 13:59:07',NULL,NULL,'file.document','Blank.docx'),(59,21,'','At the beginning of the 19th century, Barking was fast becoming a well-connected and established parish with a large resident workforce for London.

He made the case that, if he was called up on army service, serious hardship would ensue, for financial and business obligations and because of his domestic position. He also stated that he had a conscientious objection to taking part in combatant service. He was then 37, married for the second time and working as a carpenter in building construction. His employers were Dove Brothers of Cloudsley Street, Islington but he gives their address as the Royal Ordinance Factories Building, Works Department, Woolwich Arsenal.\n\nLiving in Noel Park in 1916, Albert had come a long way from where his family were recorded as living when he was twelve in 1891. His parents, William and Eliza, were from Bedfordshire, William was a bricklayer and Albert was the fifth of six children aged between 16 and 6 all living at 74 Campbell Road. Today, you can just see the street name on a cul de sac of modern buildings off Seven Sisters Road, near Finsbury Park station. When Albert lived there it was the famous ‘Campbell Bunk’ or ‘The Worst Street in North London’, (see Jerry White’s book with that title, published in 1989). Twenty years later the census shows us that the family had moved further north to Corbyn Street, still in Islington, and now comprised Albert, now a widower, and four sisters, two working as sewing machinists working at home making white lawn aprons, another sister who worked as a clerk and a five year old niece. Albert was to marry again later that year and presumably between then and 1916 had moved to Noel Park.\n\nIt seems likely that Albert was a central figure in his close family network and that this was his reason for resisting conscription but we have no details, nor do we know if he was a member of any particular group of war resistors. He seems to be typical of those men who had worked out their views on their own and who did not benefit from the support which an organisation like the No Conscription Fellowship could give them.\n\nThe Wood Green tribunal rejected his case on the grounds that ‘no serious hardship’ would come from his being called up and that his claim on conscientious grounds ‘did not satisfy’ them. He appealed, saying that the tribunal had not paid attention to his objection to military service on ‘Moral and conscientious grounds’, only his domestic situation. He also pointed out that he was ‘working on work of National Importance’. He added that he would ‘absolutely refuse to assist in any way in this war until the highest Appeal Court (his underlining) has considered my case’. His appeal was dismissed in November 1916 and we hear no more as he was refused leave to appeal to the Central Tribunal.\n\nWhatever happened to him next we don’t know but after the war the electoral rolls show him still living at 17 Westbeech Road with Marguerite Ashpole and later with, presumably, his three children Dennis, Elizabeth and Cyril. His death is registered at Wood Green in 1961 when he was 82.\n','',NULL,'2017-02-13 16:59:53','2017-02-19 08:08:34',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(65,21,'','.WILLIAM JAMES BAILEY (1880 – ?)\n\n We know very little about William James Bailey as we haven’t been able to find the tribunal papers belonging to his first application for exemption. However, because he came before the Pelham Committee in 1918 we are assuming that he had made a case against military service at that first tribunal hearing. He was a meat market scalesman (someone whose job it was to weigh the meat) at Smithfield so may have gone before the City of London tribunal which possibly gave him temporary exemptions during 1916 to early 1918, as happened to others working in the meat trade. By May1918 he was 38 and it’s likely that in their desire to find ever more men to send to the front the military representative appealed against the tribunal’s exemption. However, it seems that his case went before the Pelham Committee with the result that his job was recognised as being of national importance though he was not to stay employed at Smithfield. He was to work with Edmonton Co-operative Society. Presumably this was because he was expected to make some kind of sacrifice. Maybe his earnings would be lower. We can only guess from the very few pieces of information we have.\n\nWilliam was born of parents who originated in the West Country. He himself was born in Bristol in 1880 but the family seems to have moved to London within a couple of years. In 1901, His father was a joiner working for a firm of shopfitters. William was the second oldest of five brothers and was already working in the meat trade by the time he was 21. In 1911 he is recorded as having been married for two years to Amy Elizabeth Bailey, with one child, Bessie Florence, then a year old. They were living at 10 Forfar Road, Wood Green.\n\nWe don’t know any more about him except that he and Amy Elizabeth were still living at 10 Forfar Road in 1923.

He was the second child of Sarah and Edward Allen.  On the 1901 Census, Edward is a Licenced Victualler and the family lives at his public house:  ‘The Hand and Flower’, Bow.  By now there are three children;  Edwina 8, Horace 7 and Stanley 5.  With them are living Edward’s step-mother and three servants, two of whom are bar staff.\n\nBy the 1911 Census it looks as if Edward has died and Sarah remarried as she is now Sarah Maggs – I can find no death record for Edward or marriage record for Sarah, but that is not unusual. Horace is now working as a Junior Clerk for a Wholesale Newsagents and the family is living at 2 Earlsmead Road, Tottenham.\n\nIn 1916 Horace had moved to Flat 4, 182 High Road, Tottenham, was single and working as a Clerk. He applied to Tottenham Tribunal for exemption, but we do not know his motivation.  He was, however, granted exemption from combatant service provided he joined the NCC.   As he did not appeal against this decision Horace does not appear on the Middlesex Tribunal records.\n\nAccording to Pearce he joined the NCC on 22nd March 1916 – Bedford 1st Eastern – and spent the next month in England before being sent to France on 21st April.  We know no more about his war experience.\n\nIt is likely that he married Kate Canavar in Hackney in 1926 – he was certainly married when he died (see below) and this is the only likely marriage record I can find for a man of Horace’s name.\n\nHorace sadly died in a road traffic accident in early August 1932, aged 38. There is a report of his death in the Chelmsford Chronicle of 5th August 1932, which opens “Horace Edwin Francis Allen, 38, a clerk, of Thundersley, was knocked down and killed by a motor car on Sunday when cycling on the London-Southend arterial road.   At the inquest on Wednesday, Mrs. Allen, the widow, said deceased had ridden a bicycle since he was 16 and was also a motorist.”\n\nThe verdict was ‘Accidental Death’.\n\nIWM/PR\n\nJennifer Bell','',NULL,'2017-02-19 08:36:28','2017-02-19 08:36:28',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(79,21,'','ALEXANDER ANDERSON\n\nUncategorized December 21, 2015 Leave a comment\nTo close this window and return to Men associated with Tottenham click here\n\nALEXANDER ANDERSON (1877-1926)\n\nAlexander was born on 21 May 1877 in Ormiston, which is 7 miles outside Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. Unfortunately I have been unable to find anything about his birth family or youth.\n\nBy 1911 he was married to Margaret Pearson, from Fife. They had married in 1901 (?) and had five children:  Margaret 8, Lenora 6, Charlotte 4, Alex 2, Annie 7 months and were living in Tottenham at No.2 and 11 Flat, South Witham, Mount Pleasant Road.  Both parents were very politically active, having both been involved in the founding of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (see note at end);  Alexander had stood in 1910 as a local election candidate in St. Ann’s Ward and he was well-known as a public speaker.\n\nAlexander changed jobs many times and seems to have taken whatever he could to earn enough to support his family. In 1911 he worked for a mineral water factory and by 1916 he was a Foreman Packer for Lime Juice Merchants (Alexander Riddle and Co. Ltd, who supplied the forces) and earned £2.5s a week.   The family was then living at 49 Downhills Park Road, Tottenham.\n\nOn 22nd June 1916 Alexander applies to Tottenham Tribunal for exemption on grounds of conscience based on the Socialist Ideal of Brotherhood.  He also applies on numerous other grounds:  work (supplying the forces), a young family who would suffer hardship, his own health issues: rheumatism, bad knee, bad teeth, etc. and says:“I cannot violate my conscience by killing my fellows nor betray 21 years public life and work for the Socialist ideal of human brotherhood as I understand it.”   He was given exemption provided he continued in his present employment.\n\nAt some point between then and 31 January 1917 Alexander seems to have appeared before Middlesex Tribunal – his file contains a letter to Robert Young Construction Co. Ltd. saying Alex was granted exemption conditional upon being employed by them on war work.  Robert Young were aircraft component manufacturers but at what point did Alex leave his former employment?\n\nThe following May his certificate of exemption is withdrawn after application from the Military Rep to the Tribunal. Alexander appeals against this claiming  “Serious domestic and financial hardship would fall on my 6 dependents and others and my conscience violated were I to accept Military Service.  The Local Tribunal, in reviewing my case seemed quite unable, or unwilling, to weigh evidence of appreciate facts.”\n\n On 14 June 1917 Middlesex hears his appeal to renew his certificate. Alex is now 40 years old and on 18th June 1917 his certificate of exemption is renewed to 30th September conditional on staying in his present employment – with Riddles.  There is a supporting letter from Riddles (Lime Juice Manufacturers) at this hearing.  This seems to contradict the 31st January reference to Robert Young.   It is not easy to make sense of all of Alexander’s records!\n\nOn 24th September Alex writes to the Tribunal requesting a further extension and sends another supporting letter from Riddles.   A month later the Tribunal grants a further extension, not to continue working at Riddles, but providing Alex joins the Special Constabulary.\n\nOn 13th November a letter is sent to the Tribunal from Commander of ‘N’ Division of the Metropolitan Police (Stoke Newington), referring to the fact that Alex had been granted 3 months exemption conditional on joining the Special Constabulary.  The Commander states:\n\n“I am unable to accept him in the Service. He is a well-known Socialist street-corner orator and his presence in our ranks would cause considerable dismay among the respectable public.  That there is a conviction against him on the books of obstructing the Police at Harrow two years ago also make his chance of joining the Force hopeless.”   After receiving this, Middlesex Tribunal. contact Alex telling him that “we desire that you shall join the Volunteer Force in lieu of joining the Special Constabulary.”\n\nOn 24th November Alex writes in answer to the above request asking if they have forgotten that he has a bad knee and was graded C2 as discussed at the Tribunal hearing on 24th October?   Could he instead work voluntarily in the Food Controller’s Office?  Otherwise he will do as they ask.\n\nWhen asked about dependants other than wife and children, he tells them of “Mrs. Grace Pearson, aged 73, wife’s mother is provided with a home otherwise would go to the workhouse.”   It is not clear which, if either, of the above options is allowed to Alexander.\n\nIn January 1918 he writes to Middlesex reminding them his period of three months’ exemption is almost up, asking for an appeal form and on 30th January 1918 his renewed appeal is heard. Three days later they exempt Alex subject to being in full-time work with Robert Young Construction.  No time limit seems to be attached to this exemption.\n\nThat is all we know from his records.   He died in Tottenham on 16th September 1926 aged 48.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM ONLINE SOURCES:\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAlexander Anderson (c. 1878–1926) was a British socialist who helped found the Socialist Party of Great Britain.Like most SPGB founder members Anderson had previously been in the Social Democratic Federation, however it was another individual of the same name who held various posts in that party. He was a member of the May 1904 Provisional Committee which led to the formation of the SPGB in June. .Anderson was one of the Party’s top speakers in the period before the First World War and was also active as an administrator, being an Executive Committee member from 1904 to 1922 and Party Organiser from 1909 to 1915. He was briefly Acting General Secretary in 1905 (August to October) and stood as a local election candidate in St. Ann’s Ward, Tottenham in 1910.Anderson was a house painter by trade but was more usually out of work. He married another founder member, Margaret Pearson. He died on 16 September 1926 of arterial sclerosis, aged 48.\n\nTHE DEATH OF COMRADE ALEXANDER ANDERSON (1926)\n\nObituary from the October 1926 issue of the Socialist Standard\n\nIt is with profound regret we have to inform our readers that, after a long and distressing illness, our old comrade, Alexander Anderson, died on September 16th, at the age of 48. He was one of that determined few who in 1904 made history by founding the Socialist Party of Great Britain. During the twenty-two years of our existence his loyalty to the Party and to the working class has been steadfast and unwavering. A born orator, he was never happier than when on the platform, expounding our position, or riddling that of our opponents. Hundreds attended the funeral at Tottenham Cemetery, and a short address was made on behalf of the Party. To those who did not know our comrade, a pen portrait would convey little, and to those who knew him it would be sadly inadequate. It is at intimate, human moments such as these that we realise how much is embraced in the term “Comrade.” There is an old and hackneyed saying that in death all men are equal. It is our late comrade’s chiefest glory that his life-long efforts were directed towards the achievement by mankind of equality in life. He died a member of the Party he helped to found. We tender to his wife and children the warmest sympathy of the whole Party.\n\nIWM/PR\n\nNA/MH47\n\nJennifer Bell','',NULL,'2017-02-19 09:10:07','2017-02-19 09:10:07',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(80,21,'','.','',NULL,'2017-02-19 18:35:07','2017-06-13 12:48:29',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(81,21,'','This is where the Haringey First World War Peace Forum staged a re-enactment of the protest meeting after the declaration of war in 1914','',NULL,'2017-02-19 18:42:57','2017-02-19 18:42:57',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(82,21,'','','From diaries in my possession written by William Davis, grandfather.',NULL,'2017-02-20 12:48:04','2017-02-20 12:48:04',NULL,NULL,'file.document','Appendix_operation_1933.docx'),(83,21,'','','D J Keene and Vanessa Harding, Historical Gazetteer of London Before the Great Fire Cheapside; Parishes of All Hallows Honey Lane, St Martin Pomary, St Mary Le Bow, St Mary Colechurch and St Pancras Soper Lane (London, 1987), property 104/0.

His parents were active in the Cooperative Movement and moved to London before their youngest son, Eric (also a CO qv), was born in 1897.\n\nRichard is probably better known in the WW1 Anti-War Movement than his brother Eric, though both men were extremely courageous and determined absolutists, and spent most of the War in prison. Richard was very active in the North London Herald League and became one of their leading speakers at the Finsbury Park Sunday meetings.  He met in 1916, and later married, Patricia Lynch, the Irish children’s author. She was a suffragette and working for Sylvia Pankhurst in 1916.  He became a journalist and historian of the Irish Left after the war and wrote and published several books, including ‘Smokey Crusade’, his autobiography, in 1937.\n\nIn 1916 Richard was living at the family home at 22 Bruce Castle Road, Tottenham, worked as an Engineer/Driller for a controlled establishment and was motivated to become a conscientious objector because he was a Socialist and Trade Unionist. He belonged to the NCF Tottenham Branch and the Workers’ Union.  According to Ken Weller (‘Don’t Be A Soldier’)  Richard appeared before the Local Tottenham Tribunal, but I have no papers or other evidence to back this up – he doesn’t seem to have appealed to Middlesex.  After refusal of CO status, men were given 6 weeks grace before they would be arrested.  Richard wrote:\n\n“I had a glorious six weeks. I said everything I wanted to say about the war irrespective of DORA (Defence of the Realm Act).  Moving a resolution at the weekly park meeting against the prohibition of our literature I asked everyone to buy a paper from me to reinforce their protest.  I sold hundreds from the platform, handing them out as fast as I could.  I felt that sense of freedom of the man who knows he is going to be hanged and so doesn’t care for threats from any quarter.”\n\n He was already doing Work of National Importance as an engineer but resigned to protest his conscientious objection.\n\nFinally he was arrested on 28th October 1916 for absenteeism and handed over to the military authorities.\n\nFrom then on he faced court martials and was imprisoned for the rest of the war. A Court Martial at Mill Hill on the 10th November 1916 sentenced him to 112 days hard labour.  During this sentence, on 8th December, his case was heard by the Central Tribunal at Wormwood Scrubs – they found him CO Class A and referred him to the Brace Committee.  Like his brother he must have refused to accept the conditions of the Home Office Scheme and remained in prison.\n\nRichard’s next two courts martial were at Mill Hill, on 5th March 1917 and on 14th November 1918 (after the War was over!) – each time he was sentenced to two years Hard Labour.  Each sentence was served in Wandsworth Prison.  I do not have the date of his release, but it was probably in the late spring or summer of 1919, by which time the Secretary of State had ordered that all imprisoned conscientious objectors should be released.  Like many other – particularly absolutist – COs, he served much longer than the two years which was supposed to be the maximum.','',NULL,'2017-02-21 10:02:46','2017-02-21 10:02:46',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(85,21,'','See the hfwwpf website for a biography','',NULL,'2017-02-21 10:21:52','2017-02-21 10:21:52',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(87,21,'','See the hfwwpf website','',NULL,'2017-02-21 10:41:02','2017-02-21 10:41:02',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(88,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-21 14:34:46','2017-02-21 14:34:46',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Barking Hospital Upney Lane.jpg'),(89,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-21 15:01:28','2017-02-21 15:01:28',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Sid house.jpg'),(90,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-02-21 16:05:07','2017-02-21 16:05:07',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','fate barking hospital.jpg'),(91,21,'','see hfwwpf web site','',NULL,'2017-02-21 22:20:30','2017-02-21 22:20:30',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(92,21,'','','D J Keene and Vanessa Harding, Historical Gazetteer of London Before the Great Fire Cheapside; Parishes of All Hallows Honey Lane, St Martin Pomary, St Mary Le Bow, St Mary Colechurch and St Pancras Soper Lane (London, 1987): property 105/0.

He was a Furniture Salesman, married to Ruby Garrow and with a son, Goodin (or Goodwin) Spire Lewis Hebbs born in 1905.\n\nThe elder Goodin was born on 12th December 1881 and came from a family of 8 children; their father was a Farrier, and they lived in Askele Road, Islington in 1891.   By 1901 he had moved in with his elder brother Francis and his family in a Blackstock Road mews. Francis was a Farrier like his father.   Goodin had married, had a son, and moved to First Floor, Marquis Road, Stroud Green by the 1911 Census.\n\nHis application for absolute exemption from all service began in August 1916 with an appearance before Hornsey Tribunal. His claim was made on moral grounds, which he explains in his statement.  He feels all war is wrong, the tenet ‘Might is Right’ is wrong and that his religious belief is that ‘Love is God’ but the principles of war are based on hate.   He also quotes Archibald Bodkin, the Public Prosecutor’s representative in a famous case against the No-Conscription Fellowship in May 1916. Mr. Bodkin said: “War will become impossible if all men were to have the view that war is wrong”\n\nGoodin states that this is his view too. Nevertheless Sloper turns down his application, without – apparently – any involvement of the rest of the Tribunal.\n\nOn 29th September 1916 Goodin appeals to Middlesex Tribunal. He repeats his moral objection to war and bases his appeal against Hornsey’s rejection as follows: “The Chairman refused the application giving no reason for doing so and without consulting the other members of the Tribunal.”The Tribunal rejected his appeal.\n\nWe don’t know what happened to Goodin next, until early April 1917, when he appeared before a Court Martial at Mill Hill and was given 2 years hard labour, commuted to 6 months, to be served in Wormwood Scrubs.   On 11th April and 12th May he appeared before the Central Tribunal in Wormwood Scrubs and here he set out his moral grounds again, and added that the Chair of the Middlesex Tribunal had not asked questions about his moral stance, but persisted in questioning him about the politics of the War.   At the second Central Tribunal, Goodin refused to accept the conditions of the Home Office Scheme which he was offered, and was taken to the NCC depot at Mill Hill.\n\nIn Mill Hill Barracks he met up with a number of other local COs and one of them, Llywellyn Hughes (qv), wrote an amusing poem about the men and their situation in which Goodin is mentioned.\n\nOn 1st October he was again court-martialled at Mill Hill and received a sentence of two years hard labour which he served in Wandsworth and then Brixton Prisons.   He was released in April 1919 after serving two sentences of nearly two years.\n\n*In many documents written by others, he is called GOODWIN.

Their parents emigrated to this country from The Pale of .Settlement, probably in the early 1870s as very young adults. Moses was a tailor who died in 1904 aged 53. Both Isaac and Joseph became tailors like their father and some of their siblings.   The family changed its name to Goss around 1910.   Although circumstantial evidence would suggest that the family was originally Jewish, both boys became Quakers as adults.\n\nIsaac was born in Leicester in 1880 and died in May 1943. He is buried in The Friends Burial Ground, Jordans Cemetery, Beaconsfield.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Isaac’s granddaughter Philippa\n\nIsaac lived in 1916 at 16 Connaught Road, Stroud Green. He was married with four children and owned a tailoring business. He was a man of some standing in the community, being the Hon. Secretary of the London County Council School Care Committee, running a Sunday School, a Boys Club and Summer Camps.\n\nOn 1 September 1916 he applied to Hornsey Tribunal for absolute exemption but was only given exemption from combatant service to do work of national importance. Not satisfied with this, Isaac he appealed in November to the Middlesex Tribunal, but they only confirmed Hornsey’s decision.   On 16th November he refused the Pelham Committee’s offer of work of national importance. In December 1916 he received a letter saying that the deadline for starting this work had passed and he would be called up. He refused to respond and was arrested for absenteeism in February 1917 and taken to Mill Hill Barracks.\n\nSince he was a ‘thorn in the side’ of the local Tribunal having written to them complaining about the fate of the Walker Brothers (qv), and the brutality meted out to them, and since he was known to senior officers of Eastern Command NCC, having had a meeting with them to complain about the treatment of COs at Shoreham, it is difficult to believe that he could later have been ‘forgotten’ about! However, nothing further is known – Isaac’s granddaughter, Philippa, tells us that he spent the rest of the war at home pursuing his old work. It is possible, therefore, that he was deliberately ‘forgotten about’ !\n\nHis hatred of war continued and was passed down his family. In the 1930s Isaac was very much involved in helping Jewish refugees escape from Hitler’s Germany; his son Arthur was a founding member of CND and his granddaughter Philippa was on the first Aldermaston March in 1958.\n\nNA/MH47         PR/IWM','',NULL,'2017-03-02 15:12:18','2017-03-02 15:12:18',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(110,21,'','Joseph GOSS (1890-?)\n\n\nJoseph was ten years younger than Isaac and a tailor’s cutter working for Isaac’s business, much of the time making uniforms for volunteers in the Friends War Victims Relief Committee   He was a member of the Independent Labour Party, the No-Conscription Fellowship and the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a Quaker Attender (becoming a member in March 1918) and an absolutist. As a youngster he lived with the family in Lidfield Road, Stoke Newington and as an adult lived at 31 Connaught Road – the same road as his brother and the Walker family (qv).\n\nPhoto courtesy Philippa Goss, Joseph’s great-niece.\n\nHe applied to Hornsey Tribunal for absolute exemption on 23rd March 1916; he was only offered exemption from combatant service, which he refused.   His appeal to Middlesex Tribunal on 15th May was for a variation on the NCS certificate to one of absolute exemption. Although Middlesex turned his appeal down there followed a long correspondence between them in which Joseph strenuously claimed that tribunals DID have the power to grant absolute exemption and that that had been made abundantly clear in the recent Military Service Act of May 1916 which included married men in conscription, etc.\n\nIt was clear that Joseph was going to go on pushing his case, so the authorities arrested him for absenteeism on 3rd October and took him to Mill Hill Barracks Non-Combatant Corps Depot. Joseph resisted orders and was court martialled 9 days later and given 6 months Hard Labour to be served in Wormwood Scrubs. He twice appeared before the Central Tribunal while in prison and, eventually, on 3rd November the Central Tribunal determined him a CO Class A and referred him to the Brace Committee for placement on the Home Office Scheme.\n\nHe must have continued to disobey orders and refuse the HOS work because he was court martialled for a second time on 23rd January 1917. His 2 year Hard Labour sentence was later commuted to 6 months and he served it in Wandsworth Civilian Prison from 26th January to 23rd June 1917. On release he was soon re-arrested and court martialled again on 28th June. This time his two-year sentence was not commuted and he was sent back to Wandsworth..   By January 1919 he had served three sentences and more than two years (the supposed maximum for COs). He was finally released on 8th April 1919, just three weeks after he had finally become a member of the Society of Friends.\n\nJoseph is a classic example of an absolutist CO who will accept nothing but absolute exemption and takes the consequences of being true to his conscience no matter what.\n\nNA/MH47               PR/IWM\n','',NULL,'2017-03-02 15:28:02','2017-03-02 15:30:49',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(111,21,'','THE WALKER BROTHERS\n\nThis remarkable family, living at 17 Connaught Road, Stroud Green,  produced no less than 5 sons who were COs.

All the boys bar the eldest fought for their right to have CO status (only given at Central Tribunal stage); they were  Absolutists and all 5 suffered imprisonment, brutality and other hardships for their beliefs.  Frank was a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation  (FOR) and the No-Conscription Fellowship (NCF) – the other four just of the latter.   These organisations must have been a source of support for them, as well as the fact they had each other.\n\nMany papers of these deeply pacifist men survive in the Archives of the Peace Pledge Union in London, and I was privileged to be allowed access to them by Bill Hetherington their Hon. Archivist.   There are touching letters from Charles to his elder sister, letters to  Lester Smith (qv), who is believed to have been a leading figure in the Tottenham NCF and mentor to many local COs, and details of their Courts Martial including verbatim records of two of their statements.\n\nAll five young men refused to answer any call-up papers, respond to any military orders or undress for medicals when they had been taken to Mill Hill Barracks for enrolment into the Non-Combatant Corps. All five at one time or another were given prison sentences with hard labour, and court-martialled numerous times. As they completed a sentence the authorities knew the refusals would start again and the men effectively became subject to the provisions of the so-called ‘Cat and Mouse Act’ which had been passed in 1913 to deal with hunger-striking Suffragettes.\n\nSeveral of the brothers were subject to brutality at the hands of the Army – information on this is to be found in Charles’ letters to his sister Annie, as well as questions being asked in the House.\n\n[i]From a letter from Charles to his sister Annie, dated 21st May 1916:\n\n“We have not been down here (6th Middx. Guard Barracks, Chatham) very long but the moments have been crowded with incidents.  The military authorities have given us little rest; for refusing to come to the parade ground we were put in the guard room…..The details of abuse, entreaty and physical violence are too numerous to mention.  We were then made to stand to attention by ourselves for one and a half or two hours under broiling sun.  Harry tottered and fainted.   Yesterday morning we were again brought to the parade ground but declining to drill we were marched to the back of the barracks and were driven and kicked up and down a narrow path…..The heel of the puncher was stamped and screwed on Fred’s foot as though to crush the toes.  Threats were given all the time that if we did not give in we should be more severely treated until we did.”\n\nOn 4th July 1916 questions were asked in the House of Commons about ill-treatment of COs by the military.   Hansard states:\n\n “§25. Sir STEPHEN COLLINS asked the Under-Secretary for War whether he will inquire into the allegations that have been made with regard to the treatment which certain conscientious objectors, including Fred, Charles, and Harry Walker, are believed to have undergone at the lower barracks, Chatham, on or about 18th May, and in particular if he will ascertain whether these men were knocked-about in such a manner that one of them fainted twice; and whether he proposes to take any steps in the matter?\n\nMr. TENNANT If the Hon.

Prior to that we know only that he lived with his widowed mother, Emily, at 21 Davenant Road, Islington, at the time of the 1901 Census.  Ten years later, the 1911 Census shows that he was married and living with his wife, Daisy, as a lodger with the Pratt family at 64 Romilly Road, Finsbury Park. By 1916 they have moved a short distance to 9 Cornwall Road, Stroud Green.\n\nIn 1901 Henry was described as a Postman, but on his Tribunal application he writes that he is a Post Office Worker.\n\nHenry applied for complete exemption to Hornsey Tribunal in 1916 – his grounds being that he was a Congregationalist.   On 15th August 1916 he was granted exemption from combatant service. Not happy with this Henry applied to the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal – they extended his exemption so that he could remain with the Post Office for six months, until 10th March 1917.\n\nIt seems that this permission was not extended because he was arrested as an absentee on 25th April, fined 40/- by Highgate Police Court and handed over to the military who escorted him to Mill Hill Barracks.  There Henry, like so many other Hornsey men, joined the Guardroom Branch of the No-Conscription Fellowship.\n\nOn 9th May the court martial at Mill Hill heard his case (see below), gave him 56 days hard  labour and sent him to Wormwood Scrubs to serve his sentence.   Later that month Henry appeared twice before the Central Tribunal – at the second hearing they agreed he was a CO Class A and referred him to the Brace Committee, who sent him to the Home Office Scheme at Dartmoor Work Centre.\n\nAt some point Henry was put into the Middlesex Regiment for 58 days and then transferred to Class W Army Reserve – the latter possibly on 22nd June 1919.   Possibly his time in the Middlesex Regiment started when he was taken to Mill Hill.\n\nHenry’s charge sheet for the 9th May 1917 Court Martial is held by the Peace Pledge Union and states:\n\n“The accused No.G/87063 Private Henry Horace Peacock, Depot Middlesex Regt., a soldier of the regular forces, is charged with: (when on active service) disobeying a lawful command given by his superior officer, in that he, at Mill Hill, on the 26th April, did not undress for medical inspection, when ordered to do so, by Sergeant J.

William was a plasterer who came originally from Nottingham.Hector’s brother, Leonard, was born in 1891.\n\nWinifred Robinson and Hector were married in Hackney in the last quarter of 1915. Because the national registration of all men of military age had been completed in August of that year, he was recorded as single when conscription came in in 1916. His occupation is given as clerk.\n\nIn 1916 his address was 25 Cornwall Road, Stroud Green.  Hector applied for exemption to Hornsey Tribunal four times, in February, April, July and August 1916. He applied on the grounds of hardship and conscientious objection – stating in February ‘I believe the taking of human life to be contrary to the teaching of Christ’ – but his arguments on the hardship ground became the stronger.  Each time he appeared, except in August, Hornsey gave him temporary exemption to sort out his affairs.   The Tribunal felt this was “not a case of exceptional hardship..(he has) taken upon himself voluntarily to support a mother-in-law as well as a wife….the suggestion of conscientious objection to the taking of human life appeared to be rather the attempt of an endeavour to add weight to a weak application” and they finally refused any further exemption.\n\nOn 6th September Hector took his appeal to Middlesex Tribunal, but they turned him down and stated that he had been “passed fit for garrison duty at home”.\n\nWe know little more for certain other than that he enlisted in Wood Green after September 1916. Sadly he was killed in action on the Western Front in August 1918 aged 30.   At that time he was in the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment.

When the family came to London they lived with Eliza’s brother at 59 Parolles Road, Islington.   By 1911 they had moved to 30 Florence Road, Stroud Green, where Clarence still lived in 1916.   He was then a Civil Servant in the War Office.\n\nClarence’s motivation for applying for CO status was that he was a Christadelphian*.\n\nIn March 1916 he claimed absolute exemption at Hornsey Tribunal, but was refused.  He was represented by Mr. W.A. Simper, an elder in his Christadelphian congregation, the same man who had represented Richard MacKenzie Overton (see his biography).  Alderman Sloper, the Chair of the Tribunal, seems to have objected to this representation and criticised Clarence for being represented by someone who was “apparently an advocate rather than even a friend”\n\nOn 18th April Clarence was successful in his Appeal to Middlesex Tribunal.  They granted him exemption from combatant service conditional on remaining in his present job at the War Office.  This does not seem to have happened!   He was placed in Work of National Importance by the Pelham Committee from 29th April 1916 to 18th September 1918.\n\nHe worked first for the Home Grown Timber Committee in Taunton, but was dismissed – in early 1917 – when the War Office briefly took it over.   His papers show that he had asked to be moved from Taunton anyway because the local climate adversely affected his health.  His doctor’s medical certificate states that he was suffering from ‘cardiac weakness and general debility’ and recommended that he should go somewhere more bracing.\n\nHis next job was farming in Barking, but he was reinstated in the Home Grown Timber Committee when it was taken over by the Board of Trade.in May 1917 (NB This Committee lasted until 1920, but continued to exist in various forms, latterly as the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee which was abolished in 2014)\n\nIt seems that Clarence’s doctor’s description of his poor health was accurate, because he died, aged only 43, in Hendon in 1937.\n\nIWM/PR\n','',NULL,'2017-03-02 17:00:19','2017-03-02 17:00:19',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(115,21,'','LEONARD LEWER (1894-1971)\n\nLeonard was born on 17th December 1894 in Bayswater, the fourth of five children of William and Alice Lewer.

By 1901, when Leonard was about six, the family was living in Southwark but are found ten years later on the 1911 Census at 100 Fonthill Road, Finsbury Park.  By that time Leonard’s eldest brother, Alfred George, has become a butcher’s assistant, the second brother William John is a Commercial Clerk, sister Alice is at home, Leonard is also an audit and accountancy clerk and the youngest, Emily, is at school.\n\nIn 1916 Leonard applied to Hornsey Tribunal for absolute exemption on Christian grounds in Finsbury Park. He was then living at 25 Lorne Road, Stroud Green, Hornsey. His initial application was made on 26th February, his grounds being based solely on Christian teaching and biblical quotations, though he does add that he is dispensable to his firm, Messrs. Glen and Co. of Cheapside.\n\nWe find a letter from Hornsey Town Clerk, dated 22nd March to the effect that Hornsey Tribunal is not the proper authority to hear Leonard’s case, but should be referred to the City of London Tribunal to whom his employers were applying for exemption on his behalf.   However, the claim is returned to Hornsey on 23rd May as the employers had withdrawn their business claim.  It is a moot point whether or not Leonard was still employed by them as a later hearing in July describes him as an unemployed Audit and Accounts Clerk.\n\nCertainly Hornsey Tribunal had heard his case before 5th July as there is a note with that date from the Tribunal Chair, Alderman Sloper, stating:  “He was offered exemption from combatant service but would not be satisfied with it and he intimated that he would not do any work in the national interest.”\n\nLeonard then appealed to Middlesex Tribunal, again asking for absolute exemption. His statement contains the following: “I beg to appeal against the scantly and very unfair consideration of my claim for exemption…….I wish the Tribunal to understand that I do not belong to any no-conscription organisation but base my conviction on the Word of God alone…..I take NO PART in any political affairs of this world.”  Nowhere does Leonard mention any denominational allegiance, but his application contains several references to biblical texts.   On 20th July Middlesex granted him exemption from combatant service, but I have found no further information about what happened to him for the rest of the War.

Their father, Walter, was born in Battersea and was a Builder’s Clerk.\n\nOn the 1911 Census the family was living in Beaumont Road, Hornsey Rise, but by 1916 Hubert had moved to 26 Nelson Road, Hornsey.   His brother Terence lived at the same address but we do not know if the rest of the family were there too.\n\nHubert worked as a Clerk in the Hertfordshire Surveyors’ Department in Hatfield in 1916 when he applied for exemption to Hornsey Tribunal on 24th February and cited ‘moral and humanitarian’ grounds as a basis for his conscientious objection.  We know from an article about Terence that the family were all socialists at this time.  Some sources say Hubert was a Quaker, but he never describes himself as such.\n\nHornsey Tribunal turned him down so he appealed to Middlesex Tribunal (on 11th April 1916) stating “My impression is that the Tribunal could not understand an objection based on moral and humanitarian grounds”.   Middlesex also turned down his application, as well as refusing him leave to apply to the Central Tribunal.   Hubert nevertheless sent an appeal to the latter on 13th April 1916 with these words: “It is my impression that my claim was refused [by the Appeal Tribunal] because my grounds appeared more as political opinions, whereas I maintain they were moral grounds and therefore permissible under the Act. This point was made clear by Mr. Asquith and other Cabinet Ministers when it was mentioned as ‘religious, moral and other schools of thought.’\n\nAfter these hearings Hubert was supposed to enrol in a non-NCC regiment, but we lose track of him for the next year. No military records have been found for him, so he doesn’t appear to have joined up..  Perhaps he just went on the run or hid in a safe house and was later found and picked up by the military.\n\nThe next event we know of is that he was court-martialled at Mill Hill on 9th May 1917 and sentenced to 112 days hard labour in Wormwood Scrubs.   There he was heard by the Central Tribunal on 16th May and again on 6th July. The Tribunal determined at the second hearing that Hubert was Class D., i.e. not a Conscientious Objector.\n\nHubert had two more courts martial on 20th August 1917 and 1st July 1918, when he received more sentences with hard labour, of one year and two years respectively – both served in Wandsworth Prison.   He was released by order of the Secretary of State on 24th April 1919.\n\nSo Hubert was an absolutist, obviously prepared to spend most of the war in prison rather than compromise his beliefs.

At the time of the 1911 Census the whole family lived in Beaumont Road, Hornsey Rise – but by 1916 at least Terence and Hubert had moved to 26 Nelson Road, Hornsey.   Terence was then 23 and worked as a Warehouse Clerk.\n\nLike his brother and the rest of the family, Terence was a Socialist but he became a Quaker at the end of or after the War.\n\nHis application for absolute exemption was heard by Hornsey Tribunal on 28th March 1916 and refused.  He appealed to Middlesex Tribunal who also turned him down and refused him leave to appeal to the Central Tribunal.  Nevertheless he did just this and his papers contain his statement: “I want to appeal because the Local and Appeal Tribunals refused to see any application on any other grounds than religious, contrary to pledges given by Mr. Asquith and others, e.g. religion, moral, or other schools of thought.”\n\nTerence was arrested as an absentee on 25th May and taken to Mill Hill, where he joined the Guardroom Branch of the No-Conscription Fellowship (like many other local COs).  He was put into the Royal Fusiliers but was soon facing a Court Martial at Shoreham – on 31st July – for disobeying orders and sentenced to 112 days hard labour in Lewes Prison. From here he wrote a ‘letter’ home, saying “Dear Mother, I am now in Lewes Prison. If I behave well I shall be allowed to write another letter in about two months time and to receive a reply, but no reply is allowed to this” (all this on a printed form which Terence signed!)\n\nIn August he appeared before the Central Tribunal in Wormwood Scrubs, who offered him Home Office Scheme work and referred him to the Brace Committee.\n\nFrom there he went to Denton Work Centre in Newhaven where he was engaged in road-mending work. Terence was then transferred to work for a private employer at Buxton Lime Works but he refused to accept the conditions and once again faced firstly a transfer to Dartmoor Work Centre and then a return to Exeter Prison where he was ordered to ‘rejoin his regiment’.

In 1919 it was hard labour, solitary confinement for the first month, sleeping on a hard board for the first 14 days.  No talking.

He enlisted into the Royal Army Medical Corps on 15 June 1916.  As a Christian he knew he would not be able to take part in combat but felt it his duty to help by tending to the sick and wounded.   At the end of 1915, still well before conscription came in, he was posted to Egypt.\n\nThere the Army tried to transfer him into a combatant unit (2/13th London Regiment), but “he refused to accept combatant service” and was court martialled in Egypt on 28th July 1918. He received a very harsh sentence: 5 years penal servitude – this was commuted to 2 years Hard Labour and he was reduced to the ranks. He served his sentence in Citadel Prison, Cairo.\n\nQuestions about Sydney were asked in the House of Commons on 20 and 27 May 1919 of the Secretary of State for War (Winston Churchill), referring to the fact that he had 3 years useful voluntary service in RAMC and was then transferred “against his will, to a combatant unit, although he made it quite clear that he could not conscientiously undertake combatant work”. The questioner, Col. Wedgwood, asked Churchill if he was aware “that this man has already served nearly twelve months’ hard labour; and whether it is intended to reward his voluntary service by keeping him in prison for another year?”   Obviously there was deep concern, even among the military, about Sydney’s case.\n\nBefore the War Sydney had been a member of the congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Crouch Hill since 1st October 1911.   By 1913 he had become the Secretary of the Church’s Young Men’s Debating Society which held weekly debates and some lectures and in 1914 he took on the role of their Reception Convenor (we are not certain what that entailed).\n\nSydney was only 22 when he joined up – his peace-time occupation was Clerk to Title Agents. At the time of enlistment he lived at 29 Nelson Road, Hornsey Vale. His parents were Mary and Walter Crisfield, the latter a traveller in woollen goods. According to the 1911 Census they had had 7 children of whom only two boys and two girls were still living. One son, Edwin, had died in 1902 aged 16. In 1901 the family lived at 24 Birkbeck Road (a poorer part of Hornsey) sharing the house with another family.\n\nSydney died in Lewes, Sussex in 1976 aged about 84.\n\nPR/IWM','',NULL,'2017-03-03 12:32:56','2017-03-03 12:32:56',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(121,21,'','Richard Whimster ELAND (1887-1970)\n\n Richard lived in 1916 at 48 Nelson Road, Stroud Green and worked as a Technical Journalist.\n\nHe was born in Leominster, Herefordshire on 9th January 1887 and died in Southend-on-Sea in 1970 aged 83. He attended Kingswood Boarding School in Bath and was there in the 1901 Census. The school was based on Christian principles and founded in Bristol in 18th century by Charles and John Wesley, originally for colliers’ sons, but also took a lot of the sons of Methodist Clergy. Richard’s own grandfather was a Wesleyan Methodist Minister.   The school moved to its present site in Bath in 1851**\n\nOn 21st March 1916 Richard appeared at Hornsey Military Service Tribunal to claim absolute exemption and gave as his grounds the fact that he was a Christian (Methodist), a Theosophist and a member of the No-Conscription Fellowship. The Tribunal refused absolute exemption but granted him exemption from combatant service.\n\nRichard appealed against this to Middlesex Tribunal, who confirmed his ECS provided he remained in his present job which they considered to be work of national importance.   When he later claimed renewal of his ECS the tribunal told him it was conditional upon him joining the Friends Ambulance Unit. However, when he applied to the FAU they turned him down.\n\nThe Tribunal then allowed him to do farmwork, which he undertook in Hayes, Middlesex.\n\nRichard’s Middlesex Tribunal File (National Archives – MH47) is one of the fullest I have seen, running to 115 pages.

The family lived at 48 Calabria Road, Highbury in 1901, and in 1911 were at 18 Pinchbeck Road, Spalding.\n\nRichard must have returned to London because we find him working as a Railway Clerk on the Great Northern Railway in 1916 and living at 27 Osborne Road, Stroud Green. At some point during 1916 or 1917 he moved a short distance to 40 Florence Road, Stroud Green.\n\nHe applied to Hornsey Tribunal for absolute exemption on 18th March 1916.  His claim was made on religious grounds – he was a Christadelphian.  Like many other Christadelphians he was represented at his Tribunals by a church elder – his was Mr. W.A. Simper who also represented another Hornsey man (see Clarence Claud Redmill).  Mr. Simper had a wide experience of Tribunals, yet he was unhappy about Hornsey’s proceedings and wrote a letter to its Clerk saying “On Saturday evening last, as the representative of Richard McKenzie Overton, I had the misfortune to appear before your Tribunal.  I have now appeared before several Tribunals in North London in the same capacity. I have been publicly thanked by the Chairman and members for putting my cases so clearly before them.  The Hornsey Tribunal is the only one where I have received coarse abuse and the members will in a little time doubtless feel utterly ashamed of their want of courtesy.”\n\nHornsey refused Richard absolute exemption, but did offer exemption from combatant service.\n\nThe next step was an appeal to Middlesex a month later. This hearing gave Richard conditional exemption provided he obtained work of national importance within 21 days and conditional upon the future decision on the position of Christadelphians (there was a move in Parliament to make all professing Christadelphians automatically exempt from military service – this had been their position in the USA since the time of the American Civil War).\n\nThe Pelham Committee found him farm work in Spalding, where he remained from 18th April 1916 to 24th July 1917.  However, Richard became very ill doing this work, with asthma and severe hay fever, and asked for a transfer to clerical work.  He even found himself a position with Handley Page in Cricklewood.  However the Tribunals refused to sanction this move and insisted he remained working the land.  The Pelham Committee, Handley Page and Holland (Lincs.) County Executive Committee (who had also offered him work) all argued his case.   After numerous refusals Middlesex Tribunal finally gave permission and he transferred to Handley Page.\n\nSadly Richard died young in Southwark in 1925, aged only 34. One is left wondering if his early death could be connected with his experiences being forced to work on the land?\n\nNA/MH47','',NULL,'2017-03-03 13:00:20','2017-03-03 13:00:20',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(123,21,'','Albert George HOOPER (1883-?)\n\n Albert was 33 and married in 1916, living at 41 Osborne Road in Stroud Green.

He married Dorothy Burr, from Walthamstow, in Hackney on the 5th July 1915.\n\nBecause he was already a married man Thomas did not become eligible for conscription until after the May Military Service Act came into force. He then worked as an Assistant Secretary and Translator for the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and lived at 24 Woodstock Road, Finsbury Park.\n\nHis application to Hornsey Tribunal on 23rd June 1916 for exemption on grounds of conscience stated: “I hold war to be an absolute negation of morality and common sense and only productive of wholesale misery and evil results.”   He had a letter of support for his case from the Spanish Chamber of Commerce but his application was dismissed. His papers reveal this was because “He states that he is an agnostic”.  (There is an interesting letter among Thomas’s Middx.

He was an absolutist and on 18th March 1916 he applied for, and gained, absolute exemption from Hornsey Tribunal.

He claims that his civilian work – at the time GPO Sorter – is of national importance and he should be allowed to continue doing it, and also that Hornsey has acted incorrectly in varying his certificate.   He lost his appeal.\n\nWe do not know where he was between June and October, but he was arrested as an absentee on 10th October and escorted to Mill Hill Non-NCC Depot to be enlisted.\n\n16 days later he was before a Court Martial – presumably for ‘disobeying orders’  – and sentenced to 112 days hard labour served in Wormwood Scrubs.\n\nOn 3rd November he put his case to the Central Tribunal, now citing more recent legislation and claiming that the Military Rep’s. appeal had been ‘based on a misconception as is now shown by the declaratory clause in the Military Service Act (Session ll) 1916.

In 1911 the census shows Walter living at 54 Hewitt Avenue, unmarried aged 21 and born in St Pancras. His father was also a piano repairer. This was of course a time when the piano was a central feature in many homes and the piano industry employed many workers. Walter was one of five children, of whom four were still at home, he being the oldest of these.\n\nHe set out his health problems in detail. At 27 and working as a piano repairer for a firm on New North Road he was suffering from ‘very painful’ varicose veins as well as ‘bronchial and nasal catarrh’. He describes having to wear an elastic bandage from ankle to above his knee on his left leg and having to ‘syringe his nose with a nasal douche’. Despite this, the Wood Green Tribunal rejected his case on the grounds that they were not satisfied that he had made a case for his conscientious objection on ‘religious &amp; moral grounds’ and because he had been examined by the Medical Board at Mill Hill which had passed him for ‘general service’.\n\nThere was much debate in parliament and elsewhere about what the gradings meant with many men being passed as Grade 1, fit for active service, when they were suffering from conditions like tuberculosis and heart disease. With a grading of 2 it is possible that Walter was regarded as fit enough for ‘general service’ in garrisons at home and abroad, but not the front line.\n\nHis case for absolute exemption was turned down so he made an appeal, stressing his opposition to war, ‘on moral and conscientious grounds’, stating that ‘I have always been an anti-militarist. I hold that war is legalised murder, and were it not for piling up arms in times of peace, it would never happen at all’ and ‘nations should disarm and settle their disputes by arbitration’.\n\nIt’s difficult to be certain what followed as his papers are not complete. His appeal against his grading is dismissed in May but in November he applies for a medical re-examination, bringing evidence from a CW Parsons, possibly his own doctor, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, whose address is 23 Salisbury Road, Noel Park. The letter is stamped ‘Medical Assessors London’ and, after listing all his medical conditions which now also includes conjunctivitis, states that Walter is ‘unfit for active military service’. His application is allowed and he is assessed again as being Grade 2.\n\nWe don’t know if he continued to make appeals against this grading, accepted it, was finally exempt, refused duties or what his further war time experiences were. In the end if he was able to avoid combatant service it seems that this was on health grounds rather than his hatred of war. In 1918 he is on the electoral roll at 54 Hewitt Avenue and is probably the same Walter James Downing who, in 1922, married Henrietta Violet Lane, a clerk shorthand typist, two years younger than himself. Later electoral rolls show them living in Bush Hill Park, Enfield. He died at the relatively young age of 51 at Middlesex Hospital in June 1941.\n\nPR/IWM\n','',NULL,'2017-05-10 07:07:39','2017-05-10 07:13:42',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(214,21,'','ERNEST TARRANT SMITH (1886-?)\n\nErnest was born in 1886 in Kentish Town.

In support of his application he has a letter from a Sgt. Gordon Storm serving with the RAMC who had known Ernest for 15 years and testified to his genuineness. Ernest also stated that he had “been a member of the Alpha Union, Letchworth for the last 6 years, which has as its objects the healthy reconstruction of souls and bodies and the peaceful evolution of a juster and happier social order” and continues that he would undergo personal suffering rather than violate his conscience.   Finally Ernest submitted a personal diary of 1912 which contained a statement to show he believed the same then as in 1916.\n\nWood Green dismissed his application, claiming “The man does not belong to any religious sect or Church, neither is he a member of a society one of whose tenets requires its members to hold a conscientious objection to military service.”\n\nOn 24th October 1916 Ernest appealed to Middlesex Tribunal but again his claim was dismissed.   Ernest was an absolutist and would not have given up there.  He tried to appeal to the Central Tribunal but was not allowed to at this stage.\n\nWe know nothing of what happened between October 1916 and April 1917;  he must have ‘gone on the run’ or simply continued his civilian life without being noticed by the authorities.  In April 1917 he was picked up and taken to Mill Hill Barracks.  Here Ernest joined the Guardroom Branch of the No-Conscription Fellowship along with many other local COs.\n\nHe was court martialled at Mill Hill on 16th April and sentenced to 112 days Hard Labour served in Wormwood Scrubs from 19th April to 19th July.  During this time he appeared twice before the Central Tribunal;  the outcome is not known, but either they would have dismissed his case or found him to be a genuine CO and offered him Work of National Importance or Home Office Scheme Work Centres – if the latter were the case it is probable that he would not have agreed to their terms, because he remained in prison.\n\nA further court martial followed on 30th July 1917 and this time he was sentenced to two years Hard Labour, which was served in Wandsworth Prison.   By January 1919 Ernest had served two sentences and nearly two years – he was released under the ‘two year rule’ on 22nd April 1919, after which we lose sight of Ernest.\n\nIWM/PR\n\nNA/MH47\n','',NULL,'2017-05-10 07:29:09','2017-05-10 07:29:09',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(216,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-05-12 15:47:46','2017-05-12 15:47:46',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','The_Monument_1750.jpg'),(217,21,'','x','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:10:06','2017-05-16 12:10:06',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(218,21,'','x','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:20:13','2017-05-16 12:20:13',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(219,21,'','z','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:22:16','2017-05-16 12:22:16',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(220,21,'','x','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:24:30','2017-05-16 12:24:30',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(221,21,'','x','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:27:52','2017-05-16 12:27:52',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(222,21,'','x','',NULL,'2017-05-16 12:37:35','2017-05-16 12:37:35',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(223,21,'','GEORGE WILLIAM MORGAN 1886\n\nGeorge Morgan had been working as an omnibus conductor since 1914 when he made his case for exemption at the Wood Green Tribunal. His claim was made on grounds of health but also because he wrote, ‘I am a Socialist and an Internationalist. I believe in the International Brotherhood of Man. I hold that war is inconsistent with civilisation’. \nHe was living at Arundel Villa, Arundel Villa, Ewart Grove, Wood Green and was single at the time of his appeal, when his case was dismissed.\nThe tribunal were having difficulties sorting out his identity as he had used a different name when he was younger. His mother was drawn into the discussion in order to prove why his name had been Golding when he had been discharged from the Territorial Forces in 1908. She explained that George and his siblings had taken the name of her second husband, Golding, and for some reason had used that name when he was in the Volunteers.  For all other important matters she made sure that they used their own name, Morgan. \nGeorge had hoped that having been discharged from the Territorials he would be exempt from conscription, but this was not to be. He appealed against the dismissal of his case on the grounds that he didn’t have a fair hearing. He produced evidence to support his views and ‘was then only asked if I would work on a mine-sweeper’. He refused and in his appeal argued: ‘The chairman refused to deny that I was a genuine objector, the inference being that he knew that I was.’ His conscience was seen as ‘political’ and so he lost his appeal.\n\nBy October he had lost his case.

In his case for absolute exemption he described himself as ‘Superintendent of the Drug Department Apothecaries Hall &amp; registered with the Pharmaceutical Society as the responsible chemist.’ He had been working for the Society of Apothecaries for 10 years, had won prizes and gained first class certificates.  What made his work so important, his employer stated, was that he dispensed doctors’ prescriptions which were unusual and which allowed for no margin of error. By 1916 he was the only person left on the staff with the experience that this required.  His occupation was included in the official list of Certified Occupations. \n\nHowever Charles was also a conscientious objector. He wanted his opposition to war to be accepted as the basis for his exemption because: ‘I believe all warfare to be contrary to the teachings of Christ &amp; have held this opinion ever since I was able to judge for myself’. Moreover, as he emphasised, because his work involved ‘the relief of human suffering’ he could not take the military oath. Unless the Wood Green Tribunal agreed that his case was genuine he could not claim exemption on those grounds. Like many other COs he was not prepared to sacrifice his principles. \n\nCharles was one of the seven children of Arthur and Ada Bayley and was born in Islington in 1879. He was the second of four sons, all of whose middle name was Wesley. Arthur Bayley was a self-employed writer of medical labels, and three of his sons, Charles, John and Herbert became pharmacists. At the time of the 1911 census Charles, aged 30, had married May Burgess and they were living at 63 Caxton Road, Wood Green. Arthur was 33, married with a young baby and working as dispenser pharmacist at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and John was a ‘visitor’ aged 30 and a ‘pharmaceutical student’ staying with a family in Brighton. The family had all moved to Brighton in the 1880s and the three youngest children were born there. \n\nCharles’ Tribunal story begins in June 1916 when he made his first bid for exemption on grounds of conscience. In August he appeals against the decision of the Wood Green Tribunal that he should be granted temporary exemption ‘on business grounds’. He insisted that he was not given an opportunity to make his case on grounds of conscience. He points out that he can’t be accused of cowardice since it would have been quite easy for him to have enlisted in the Army Medical Corps or Sanitary Corps because of his training and qualifications. He also points out that he is a member of the Society of Friends (a Quaker) and that he had joined the No Conscription Fellowship before the National Service Act was passed. \nIn October he is told that his appeal has been adjourned, he is now under the Pelham committee and must look for work of National Importance, and which would involve a sacrifice, which the Appeal Tribunal will approve. \n\nOn 3 November 2016 his employers at Apothecaries Hall write to the Appeal Committee to ask if he can stay in his present position as there is no other chemist qualified to carry out his work. The Appeal Committee reply on 9 November saying that they do not consider Mr Bayley’s work to be of National Importance.  Charles then writes back the same day to say that he has followed up the recommendation of the Pelham Committee to apply for work at British Dyes Ltd but that the company had replied that they were unable to take him on as his training is so different to their work. He asks for more time and offers to donate some of his salary to a charity named by the Tribunal. \n\nOn 10 November the Pelham Committee write to the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal to ask if it might be possible for Charles to remain at his current job. They follow this up with a letter asking if he could have a further extension of time while he seeks alternative work. \n\nOn 14 November the Appeal Tribunal write to Charles to say that they could not allow him to stay in his present job but would give him an additional 7 days to find work of National Importance.\n\nCharles writes to the Middlesex Tribunal on 18 November to say that he was been to firms recommended by the Pelham committee but that he is usually told that it would be physically impossible for him to do the work and that he would be wasting his qualifications. He had accepted work as a fitter’s mate at Messrs Lyle &amp; Sons, working from 6 am to 6 pm but that when the foreman went to the secretary to get him signed up for the job, the secretary ‘refused to let me have it as he felt it would be insulting me although I was quite willing to take it’. \n\nFinally, on 28 November the Pelham Committee were prepared to recommend that he take up work as a chemist for the British Malt Products Co in Bermondsey. They point out that their work is an essential part of the process for making gun cotton and for use in aeroplanes and for soldiers’ masks, as well as for other staple industries such as bread and glycerine production. This was approved by the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal the next day. At the beginning of December the Tribunal agrees that Charles should be exempt from the Military Service Act and recognise that this is on the basis of his conscientious objection.  He had gained exemption he wanted and had also complied with the requirement that he accept a sacrifice. His annual salary of £180  was now only £125 a year. \n\nDid Charles ultimately compromise his principles by taking a job which was part of the chain of war production, or did he feel that he had successfully made his case? We can’t know and we don’t know what happened to him after the war except that when we contacted the Society of Apothecaries archives we were told that he was still registered there in 1921, employed at British Malt Products. He and Ada were still living at 63 Caxton Road, Wood Green in 1919 according to the electoral register and he is almost certainly the same ‘Charles W’ whose death is recorded in Brighton, aged 72 in 1951. \n\nIWM/National Archives\n','',NULL,'2017-05-18 15:19:06','2017-05-18 15:19:06',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(225,21,'','MONTEFORD DAVID MORGAN (1875-?) \n\nThere is some confusion over this man’s first name – he appears variously as Monkford, Montford and Monteford on Censuses and Middlesex Tribunal papers have him as Montague. He signs himself as Monteford.\n\nHis address at the time of his dealings with the Tribunals was 30 Clarendon Road, Hornsey and his occupation was ‘Butcher’s Carman and Horsekeeper’  for Mr. Randall, Butcher, 82 High Street, Highgate. Born in 1875 he was already 41 in 1916.\n\nWe know a fair bit about his birth family from Census records. In 1971 Mary Morgan, the woman who was to become his mother, lived with her 2 year old daughter Florence and her  own parents Richard and Esther Thorn in Elders Cottages, New Road, Hornsey.   By 1881 Mary has moved to Rose Cottage, Hornsey, with Florence and 6 year old Monteford – she is a widow and a dressmaker.  On the 1891 Census they have moved again to Harringay Road.  As well as Florence and Monteford, there is now a grand-daughter, Daisy, aged 1.  She is a bit of a mystery as Mary is still a widow, both Florence and Monteford are single and there is no evidence of Mary having had other children.   There is a lodger, William Brown.   Ten years later, in 1901 the family has moved to 33 Middle Lane and on this Census Daisy is  described as ‘daughter’ and there is another ’son’, Henry Morgan, aged 8.  Mary is now 58 and too old to be his mother.   Is it possible that both Daisy and Henry were, in fact, Florence’s children?  We learn from the 1911 Census that Florence is, in the words of the census, ‘totally blind’     Monteford later describes his sister as ‘blind and paralysed’.  In 1911 Daisy has left the family home, which is still at 33 Middle Lane.\n\nAccording to Pearce Monteford appeared before Hornsey Tribunal on 5th December 1916 and was given exemption from combatant service conditional on doing work of national importance. .  The Middlesex records are confusing to say the least and appear all to date from 1918, though it is difficult to distinguish between the typed 1918 and 1916 on some!\n\nThe best I can make of the information to hand is that Monteford received a series of temporary exemptions and that at some point he did work of national importance with Aircraft Manufacturers in Park Royal.\n\nHis employer appealed for him to be given exemption, but as this paper is undated it could be Mr. Randall the butcher, or F.W. Berwick and Co, Aircraft Builders, for whom Monteford  worked as his WNI.\n\nAlthough Monteford had applied for exemption on only one ground: conscientious objection, his papers supporting his application apply mainly to family reasons.  He says he is the “soul (sic) support of the home and has been for 25 years. My mother is 75 years old and my sister is paralysed and blind.”  He goes on to say that he will be 43 later that month, so it must be  in1918.  Hornsey Tribunal, on 18th March 1918 wrote:  “This man was unable to satisfy the Tribunal that he should be further exempted” and go on to refer to a letter he had shown them “purporting to come from a Clerk of Works but unsigned.”  In the Middlesex pack there is such a letter, but it is indeed clearly signed.\n\nUnfortunately we know no more about this man and his family during the rest of the War and afterwards.\n\nIWM/PR\n\nNA/MH47\n','',NULL,'2017-05-21 06:53:54','2017-05-21 06:53:54',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(226,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-05-21 07:08:14','2017-05-21 07:14:53',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','BrownTom_b1880_1.jpg'),(227,21,'','ALFRED WILLIAM BUTLER (1890 – ?)\n\n Alfred Butler was living at 228 High Road, Wood Green, in June 1916 when he made his application for absolute exemption from military service. He had married Violet Bennett just three days before the outbreak of war, on 1 August 1914. The 1911 census shows him as single, living at 4 Rectory Road, Hornsey, working as a warehouseman and born at Old Ford, London. His father was a printer compositor, and he and Alfred’s stepmother had been married for 10 years but had no children of their own. The records suggest that his mother died at or around the birth of his sister, Miriam, in late 1893 when the family was living in Bethnal Green.\n\nWhen he came before the Wood Green Tribunal Alfred gave his occupation as ‘stock keeper and salesman’ working for a wholesale draper’s firm on London Wall. He supported his case with letters from Arthur J Johnston, ex-president of the Dunstable Men’s Adult School and from James Muirhead a paper pattern manufacturer in Dunstable. Both of them testified that they had known him for several years, that he was a Christian and a believer in the brotherhood of man, and a genuine conscientious objector. We don’t know what his connection with Dunstable was or why his Quaker connections were there. He wrote to the Tribunal in September 1916 saying ‘Pacifist principles alone can reform the world… the Doctrine of Love only, can be opposed to Hate with certainty of Success’. The Tribunal rejected his claim, writing that Alfred was not a member of any religious body or society and was a member of the No Conscription Fellowship, moreover he ‘did not appear willing to undertake any work of National Importance’.\n\nHe gave notice that he intended to appeal to the Central Tribunal in October, arguing that the local tribunal had in fact offered him work of National Importance and that he had the right to exemption. However he was not allowed to make the appeal.\n\nWhat happened next is not totally clear. He seems to have been allocated to the Home Office scheme but having refused this was court martialled at Mill Hill in November 1916 and given 112 days hard labour at Wormwood Scrubs. He was transferred to Wandsworth prison where many COs were held at that time, and court martialled twice more so that by January 1919 he had served four sentences and more than two years. He was released from Wandsworth prison by order of the Secretary of State on 8th April 1919 when the government announced that men imprisoned under the Army Act (this included deserters and others convicted of offences as well as COs) who had served two years could be released.\n\nWe don’t know what happened to him after the war, nor how Violet, his wife managed while he was in prison. He certainly stuck to his convictions, something which perhaps the Wood Green Tribunal had not expected. All we know of the couple is that they were living at 17 Vernon Road, North Haringey ward, according to the electoral rolls, between 1923 and 1926.\n\nPR/IWM','',NULL,'2017-05-21 07:36:40','2017-05-21 07:36:40',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(228,21,'','GEORGE COBDEN (1895 – ?)\n\n George Cobden was only 20 when he made his application to the Wood Green Tribunal for exemption from military service in February 1916. In 1911, the census tells us that he was living at 13 High Road, Wood Green, with his parents, Charles and Hellen (sic) and six siblings, including his twin brother Bertie. He was one of 15 children of whom 10 had survived and six were living at the High Road address. His father was a wood grainer and painter. George was working as a shop assistant in provisions. Bertie was also a shop assistant, in tailoring.\n\nWhen George appears before the Tribunal he gives his occupation as shop assistant, working for J Sainsbury at 424 High Road, Tottenham. He made his case on grounds of conscience but also because of his ‘domestic position’. Though he doesn’t explain his personal circumstances we can perhaps guess that because his father had died a few days after the outbreak of war he may have become the main support to his mother if all the other siblings had left home, apart from his younger sister and brother.\n\nSo far as his case for exemption on grounds of conscience is concerned he is clear: ‘as a socialist believing in the brotherhood of all mankind (I) cannot conscientiously take part in the organisation for the slaughter of my fellowmen. It is revolting to the whole of my feeling, my views, my hopes and to my faith in the future of humanity and it would be an action for which I can find no justification in my mind or conscience’.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected his claim because it was ‘… not sufficiently strong’ and ‘…appeared to be based on political grounds’. He was refused leave to appeal. However George did not give up, writing in May to say that ‘…I consider my conscientious objection to militarism is genuine and valid well substantiated by the fact of my having belonged to the S.P.G.B. (Socialist Party of Great Britain) for over two years…. the principles of which party are opposed to militarism’. He pointed out that they could easily have checked this as his friend had accompanied him and had ‘personally protested’ at not being given an opportunity to speak. He also rejected the tone of the ‘hypothetical questions’ raised at the Tribunal saying that these were ‘bordering on the extreme and would never arise’. He was probably asked what he would do if a German threatened to attack his mother. This was the sort of question which was often put to conscientious objectors at tribunals.\n\nWe know no more about what happened to George during the war. After, the passenger records show him sailing in 1922 to New York, second class on the Berengaria, giving his occupation as ‘Provis Hand’, still working in provisions it seems, with his country of future residence being the USA. From then, until 1957 he makes trips across the Atlantic every two years, apart from during World War Two. He is presumably still alive in 1960 when his twin brother Bertie makes the trip across. Only once, in 1928, did he come with his wife, Alice, a secretary, and US citizen. He gained US nationality and seems to have stayed in the retail trade, working as a ‘salesman’ and then as a ‘supervisor’. He must have done well for himself as from 1947, when only 52, his occupation is given as ‘retired’. In 1922 he left a continent which had witnessed a gross waste of human life, but over the years seems to have kept close links with his own family.\n\nPR/IWM\n','',NULL,'2017-05-21 07:44:24','2017-05-21 07:44:24',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(229,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-05-22 14:10:50','2017-05-22 14:10:50',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Coat of Arms - Front.jpg'),(230,21,'','David Ablett was the second eldest of the six children of Alfred and Fanny Ablett and was born in Ealing on 21 December 1891.

Did you use to work in public libraries before? What attracted you to the role? Was this your first job? Have you studied for a professional qualification in Library and Information Science? \n\nI began work here in September 1999! I had just completed a degree in English Language and Literature. I thought I’d like to work in a library as I love books and learning. I was extremely happy when I found out the post was in the Barbican Library in the Barbican Centre – how wonderful to work in such a big, beautiful library in an arts centre! It was my first full time, permanent job.  It was a while before I decided to do a Masters degree in Library and Information Science — I had thought about going into teaching. I became a qualified librarian in 2009 and worked temporarily as a librarian in other branches before getting my current permanent role in 2014.\n\n\n•  Could you tell us a bit about what an average day of work in this library involves? What do you most enjoy doing on your routine? What is the most important ability you feel you have to master to carry out your work here?\n\nOur daily routine consists of having regular sessions on the enquiries desk and then periods ‘off desk’ for us to complete our other tasks. Enquiries desk sessions involve assisting customers with finding resources in the library, accessing eBooks and other online resources or signposting to other resources. Sourcing books for reserves, joining new members, dealing with account issues, managing the public IT suite — dealing with technical issues and helping customers with online applications and printing as well as helping less digitally savvy customers find general information for example ‘where’s my nearest job centre?’.\nI’m responsible for areas of stock in the library and I use my ‘off desk’ time to manage these areas — weeding old or unused stock, replacing damaged stock, ordering new stock. \nI organise library activities such as talks and workshops so I spend time sourcing possible events and organising and promoting them. I have to think about how to improve and promote the service. This is a time of great change due to technological effects on society which call into question the purpose of libraries and of course funding cuts. So the most important abilities to have as a librarian are flexibility, resilience and the desire to adapt whilst preserving the essence of what a library service is. In one word maybe — energy! This is not a quiet, sitting in the corner kind of job, which perhaps it was in years gone by.\n\n\n•  What are your impressions of the library’s collection? You are a member of the staff, but do you also take advantage of the library as user as well, such as borrowing books?\n\nI think the library’s collection is excellent! We are very fortunate here in that, for the time being, we still have stock librarians (rather than supplier selection). Yes absolutely, I borrow the stock for my own pleasure. I’m proud of what the library has to offer and we get many comments about the quality of our stock. I know many other public libraries are no longer able to offer the quality and range of stock that we do.  \n\n\n•  This is a very unique library when it comes to its architecture; it is inside the Barbican Estate and part of the Barbican Centre. What do you think about the spatial relationship between the library and the Barbican Estate? Are many of the library users also residents? \n\nI love working in the Barbican Centre — we’re very fortunate to be housed within a centre dedicated to culture and in such an iconic architectural building. Many residents are library members who have been using us for years and they appreciate how lucky they are to have such a wonderful library on their doorstep. The bulk of our customers however are City workers.\n\n\n•  Have you witnessed changes or renovations of the library building during your time here? What are your personal impressions of the physical aspects of this library? How important do you think is the architecture of a library building to people’s experience of it?\n\nArchitecture in any situation has a powerful effect on the people interacting with it. The library has had some big changes to its enquiries desk and some shelving areas, but essentially the structure can’t be changed too much because it’s part of the centre which is a listed building. The space is not ideal for a modern library — it’s quite dark and old fashioned in places. On the other hand, the space is bold and striking and has characteristics that I think many people, including myself, appreciate and are inspired by.\n\n\n•  How have new digital information technologies affected the library and also your work?\n\nThe online catalogue is a wonderful thing and the ability to access online resources and your account from home. We fairly recently added eBooks/eAudiobooks/eMagazines to our stock which is brilliant but it seems most customers of all ages still prefer non-digital resources so essentially our job hasn’t changed too much due to technology. We use social media a lot more for library promotion and customer engagement. I would like our website to be better — to give customers the kind of online experience they take for granted now in their daily activities. That’s a weakness for public libraries and comes down to a mixture of lack of funding and restrictions in place due to having to adhere to the corporate template which is not geared towards supporting the interactive needs of a library website.\n\n\n•  Regarding the library users, do you see many of the same faces each day? Is there any specific library user that you are usually in contact with? Are there any groups of people you especially enjoy working with?\n\nYes, we have regular customers who we see almost every day or at least every week. Some we recognise only — others we know by name. As we’re such a big library with many City workers as customers we always see new faces too. I really enjoy working with the public and there are many customers who I chat with and know a little about their lives. Many customers are inspiring, a few spring to mind. One customer who is sadly no longer with us, started to write a diary and memoir on one of our computers as he didn’t have one at home. We gave him a few 1 to 1 sessions then he was off — he was 92. Another one of our IT customers, in her 90s, is now using her tablet to access Facebook and email so she can keep in touch with distant family. A customer, who is 84, comes to the library regularly to plan her solo world travel adventures using our travel guides and to regale us with her adventures. A young teenager who has been using the library since he was about 10 years old — he always came alone, without parents, to use the computers and often got into trouble for being a little disruptive. He now comes in, still alone, and borrows books on philosophy, science, politics and classic literature. To see someone develop and use the library to educate themselves is inspiring.\n\n\n•  What do you think is unique about public libraries, and maybe about this library in particular? What do you think makes people value them?\n\nPublic Libraries are unique in that they are the only indoor public space I can think of that is open to all, is free and is somewhere you can have a very personal experience, shaped by your own tastes and needs, as part of the community. It’s private and public at the same time. In an art gallery you go to see the art and you’re aware it’s not ‘your space’. The library belongs to the community — it’s their space. It’s a truly democratic space and it’s a refreshingly non-commercial space.  I think this is ever more important as there become fewer non-commercial public spaces in society.\n\nIt’s a place without monitoring. Someone can do research or choose a book or film knowing that their choice is not being filtered through to organisations who may use that information to target them with advertising or political messages like the internet. \n\nPeople value libraries because of the above and because they are spaces where they can feel safe, comfortable and supported. They offer a sense of freedom and the potential to be transported, for personal and intellectual growth as well as escapism and relaxation.\n\n\n•  From your experience, what role do you think this library plays in the life of its users? What do you think the contemporary public library means to its users and local community? What do you think goes missing when a public library shuts down?\n\nFrom the many comments we get from customers we know this library plays a very important role to them intellectually, socially and emotionally.  As well as the access to books and other resources, they appreciate the community and social aspects. They like to share a space with others, they like to talk to the staff or other customers.  When a public library shuts down, the community loses a place to come together and becomes more dislocated.  It loses access to education, culture and the internet that many are not in a position to replace by private means and to many people that loss can be frightening and disheartening.  For many, the library is a life line to help them through difficult times. \n\n\n•  What does this library mean to you personally; what part does it play in your life?\n\nI’m aware of how important this library is to those who use it and that motivates me to do all I can to contribute to it being a good service.  I personally love libraries and believe in their value and importance to society and the individual and I particularly love this one as it’s still a good library and hasn’t suffered too badly so far due to cuts. It’s very sad to see a library service that is only such in name and is no longer able to serve its essential function due to funding cuts.\n','',NULL,'2017-06-26 19:54:24','2017-06-26

worked in this library; could you tell us during what period you were employed here, and your position? What were your duties, and what was the environment like? \n\nI worked for City of London Libraries from Aug 2008 to Apr 2017 as a Bibliographical Support Assistant for the Bibliographical Services Section. BSS, located under Guildhall Library, was a centralised section that supported Guildhall Library, City Business Library, Barbican Libraries, Shoe Lane Library, Artizan St Library and Community Centre, and London Metropolitan Archives. \n\nMy duties over the eight years I worked there included cataloguing resources, working on authority control, managing inter-library loans, implementing electronic resources, setting up and running a few social media feeds for other sections, and one representing all the libraries, the City of London Libraries Tumblr which I ran until April this year. It was an odd role in that it started off with some very defined duties, but expanded over time due to changes in staff numbers, and just generally from the desire to grow as a professional and try out new ideas.\n\nThe environment was an interesting one, especially as the office in which I worked was in the same building as Guildhall Library and City Business Library. It afforded the luxury of getting up close and personal with the collections of Guildhall Library, which includes the First Shakespeare Folio, and the deed to a property owned by the playwright. It also meant working in a location that had a lot of history connected to it. \n\nIn BSS the work we handled comprised of ordering and processing stock, looking after the library management system and the OPAC, implementing electronic resources, cataloguing and authority control, and generally what you would expect from a centralised bib service. It could be a somewhat pressurised environment because of the workload, but it taught me a great deal about time management and juggling various aspects of such a demanding role. \n\n\n•  Was this your first job? What attracted you to the role? Have you studied for a professional qualification in Library and Information Science? \n\nNo, not my first job, or my first library job. My first library job was in a sixth form college, where I was advised by my manager to consider studying for a MLiS as I seemed to have a knack for library work. The role at City of London Libraries was my first role after qualifying, and what attracted me to it was the prospect of paid library work! \n\n\n•  Could you tell us a bit about what an average day at work used to involve? What did you enjoy doing most on your routine? What was the most important ability you felt you had to master to carry out your work here?\n\nAn average day by the time I left was as follows: coming in and checking general email inquiries, checking all inter-loans correspondence, and checking emails regarding ebook problems. Emails answered, I would then move on to do some cataloguing which would continue through the day interspersed with other duties. \n\nLunchtime I would check all the emails again, this time looking through our inter-loans slips to see what we managed to borrow, and what we were lending, what to report back to all the libraries involved, and also keeping in check items for claiming payment. \n\nAs I had also developed social media consultations for City Business Library, a few times a week, an hour or two might have been taken up by a consult or tutorial. Other social media related activities included photographing items for Guildhall Library feeds (such as their Twitter/Instagram or Pinterest), training colleagues on social media uses, as well as setting up feeds. \n\nAs social media can be demanding, probably like a lot of librarians, a lot of the material I cultivated for our Tumblr was usually done during lunchtimes and put in a queue to be released later - even so, running the Tumblr was my favourite personal project. Aside from this I also spent a lot of time answering queries to do with electronic resources.\n\n\n•  What were your impressions about the library’s collection? You were an employee, but did you also take advantage of the library as user as well? \n\nThere were parts of our public libraries collections which I absolutely loathed, books some of us called ‘misery memoirs’, but overall I thought the libraries had a very robust collection, Barbican Music Library especially. Occasionally I felt frustrated when I didn’t see a book enter our collection, seeing its popularity rise on national book charts, but similarly I was always impressed that we often had titles available in more than one format. I most certainly took advantage of the library as a user. One year I read 81 books because as a cataloguer up to 35 books could cross my desk in a day, of which one or two would have ended up on my to-read list. Most of those were non-fic and I was always impressed by the non-fic offerings we had. \n\n\n•  Have you witnessed changes or renovations of the library building during your time here? What were your impressions about the physical aspects of this library? From your experience, how important do you think is the architecture of a library building to people’s experience of it?\n\nI think I started working in the Guildhall building just before Guildhall Library was renovated. I have a vague memory of an older style of library being replaced by what is there now. I particularly like Barbican Library where the architecture and aura adds to the comfort of the library space. The lighting is low and soft, the space is wide and open, and there is a general warmth that somehow cancels out whatever brutalism tries to sneak into the library. I think Barbican Library is more than just its collections and services. It’s very much the physical space it occupies. \n\nI think the architecture of a library is key if you’re really interested in creating a good library space. One of the most unfortunate things happening to libraries is the lack of investment in the physical aspects . Community libraries especially seem to be a cost cutting exercise, mixing local administration with library services, creating the feel that maybe library spaces are no longer a place for someone to spend an afternoon reading or studying. The emphasis is perhaps on paying your council tax, borrowing a book, and leaving quickly.\n\nIn a time where space costs money, we need libraries that still retain a little of the old-fashioned style of segmented spaces where people can find a bit of solitude and silence, whether for study or just leisure. It’s sad that Carnegie buildings such as my local library are being sold off by councils to make profit, their beauty good enough for business, but not for the patrons who are offered in exchange boring plastic-looking spaces. Part of the public library service needs to be the creation of beautiful spaces which can be enjoyed and contribute towards the well-being of patrons.\n\n\n•  How have new digital information technologies affected the library?\n\nI think it depends on where the library is situated and whom it serves. When I worked in my local library, the highly sought after services were on-site IT (for those without internet access at home), newspapers, books, DVDs, and play-oriented sessions for young children, homework clubs to help older children. That might have changed now, but I suspect that services like the ones mentioned above are very much desired still. \n\nDuring my time at City of London Libraries, I had a hand in providing support for our e-services, and there was a healthy uptake of our online collections, such as e-audiobooks, and ebooks. However, they never overtook physical items which remained very much in demand. What they did do was attract new library members. As the person who responded to ebook queries, I used to answer many emails about terms and conditions of access to the ebooks, and over the years the ebooks turned out quite a draw when it came to library membership, as did the ability to remotely access electronic resources (JSTOR proving to be one of the most popular resources).\n\n\n•  Regarding the library users, did you use to see many of the same faces each day? Do you still remember any specific library user from your time here? Were there any groups of people you especially enjoyed working with?\n\nAs someone who worked in a back office role, I didn’t really see many members of the public. For me familiar was seeing the regular crowd reblogging posts on Tumblr or other social media platforms, and I always looked forward to any and all of these interactions. I also had a lot of time for many of the social media students I worked with. Many of these were freelancers or people with small businesses wanting to avoid the high cost of consultation and at the same time learn how to use social media for themselves rather than depend on others. Many came back for regular training, and it was always a pleasure to see their learning evolve. \n\n\n•  What do you think is unique about public libraries, and maybe about this library in particular? What do you think makes people value them?\n\nI think their uniqueness lies inthe fact that they are related to a philanthropic ideology. They are not businesses, but institutions. They are not meant to generate income or make profit. They are meant to serve communities regardless of wealth or status. At the most basic level, a library can provide resources such as a PC, an internet connection, books, DVDs, etc. However, public libraries, where professionals haven’t been replaced by volunteers or managers who have no library background, also have staff that help people to navigate resources, come up with teaching programs, or programs that cultivate community cohesion. The public library when well-funded can be a community hub that actively contributes to the well-being of its community, rather than seeking out ways of how to profit from that community. \n\n\n•  What role do you think this library played in the life of the local community by the time you used to work here?\n\nAs someone who mostly worked behind the scenes, I didn’t get a lot of direct experience of how the libraries were impacting members of the community they served. From having spoken to patrons trying to tackle problems accessing audio and e-books online, I got a sense that particular services were a boon to those patrons who found it difficult to physically visit the library. I also saw that people who moved in and out of the city (office workers, as an example), were drawn to using the libraries because of access to online resources. City Business Library ran a lot of job-search initiatives which I assisted with a few times, and those were seeking to help people improve their chances in the job market through CV workshops, training on using library resources, and training on using social media tools such as LinkedIn. \n\nYears ago, working in my own local library I found that services aimed at under fives were popular, allowing parents to meet other parents of young children. One mother told me that her small boy who was very shy and uncommunicative  had started to become a little more verbal since coming to the library arts and crafts sessions. Other patrons used the library to not only access the internet, but to also receive on hand guidance in how to safely navigate the internet. Others required help in filling in complicated forms because their level of literacy didn’t quite cut it. The library, to me, felt like an essential service that was always there to help. Based on this, I would say most local libraries probably play a similar role in the local community. \n\n\n•  You don’t work here any longer; do you still work in libraries? What are some of the knowledge and lessons you have taken with you from working as a public librarian here?\n\nI now work in a law library, which is another brand new learning curve for me. I’m lucky that previous learning curves include working in a college library, a number of public libraries, and back room services for both public and reference libraries. It’s given me a wealth of insight. Patience and tolerance are key. Friendliness is good, but so are boundaries. A desire to teach and impart knowledge is good for fostering relations with colleagues, and providing a good service to patrons. A commitment to continued learning is crucial to a fruitful library career. \n','',NULL,'2017-07-24 15:00:31','2017-07-24 15:05:06',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(642,18,'','','Centre for Metropolitan History,

Realising that there was a need for books for those whose ships came in for repair; he opened the shop to supply technical books, charts and nautical instruments, though the latter have ceased to be stocked.  Throughout the years their speciality has been technical books, particularly on nautical and marine engineering.\nIn those early years, ships were away for many months, even years, and reading was a very real relaxation.  So began the supply of Libraries on board.  Often the Library consisted of old magazines or even newspapers which were bound up between stiff covers as they had to travel many miles and in very rough conditions.  \nThose were the great days of shipping in Poplar when the East India Docks were a forest of masts and all who sailed either had their homes on board or stayed in lodgings in the district.  \nThe little shop was divided into four rooms and (these) were known rather grandiloquently as The Chart Room, The Library, The Captain’s Room and the Stationery Shop and those who came always had time to tell of their voyages and the places they had seen.  \n\nBy the time of the First World war, ships had become very much larger and the responsibility for running the libraries passed from the Ship’s Officers to the Shipping Companies and so started our connection with the P &amp; O Group of shipping companies and the Shaw Savill Lines, with whom we have been privileged to supply and maintain the libraries of such ships as the Kaiser-I-Hind, Viceroy of India, Canberra, Oriana, Southern Cross and Northern Star, allowing Seager books to travel to all the quarters of the world.\nToday our stock of books is wider and more varied than ever and we endeavour to obtain any book in print, having also a wide range of fountain pens, drawing instruments and office stationery.\"\nDespite the brave words at the end of the piece, the bookshop ceased trading soon after this was written.

It was 9.25 miles (15 km) long and started from a junction with the Grand Surrey Canal ¾ mile from Deptford, through which it was joined to the River Thames. The canal was cut through New Cross, Brockley, Sydenham, Penge Common and ended in West Croydon. It also linked to the Croydon Merstham and Godstone Railway (and thence to the Surrey Iron Railway), so that the canal could be used to transport stone and lime from workings at Merstham. \n\nConstructing the canal involved considerable feats of engineering: according to the Rees Cyclopedia of 1819 the canal had at least 30 swing bridges along its route and there were seven road bridges over the canal. It had 28 locks, arranged in two flights. With water mills operating along the Rivers Wandle and Ravensbourne requiring considerable amounts of water, the supply of water to the canal was always a problem and reservoirs were constructed at Sydenham and South Norwood - the latter is still in existence and is known as South Norwood Lake.\n\nThe canal was 34 feet (10 m) wide. It had a maximum depth of 5 feet (1.5 m). After the initial flights of locks, most of the canal followed the 161 ft (49.1m) contour. \nThe final two locks at Croydon Common raised the canal to the 174 ft (53m) contour, and because there was no natural source of water a steam pumping station was built at the foot of the locks to pump water up.\n\nBy 1811, 22 barges plied the canal. A military survey of that year gave the main goods transported up the canal from the Thames towards Croydon as: coals, corn, fir timber, groceries, stone, slate, malt and manure. Goods going down the canal from Croydon towards the Thames were: oak, elm timber, firestone, lime, fuller’s earth, flints, flour and seeds.\n\nThe barges were 60 feet (18 m) long and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide and could carry about 30 tons. They did not have living accommodation as they could complete their journey backwards or forwards between Deptford and Croydon in one day. Sadly, the fact that the Canal could only accommodate barges carrying these small loads was to make it unprofitable.\n\nThe canal was never a success and closed in 1836, the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The London &amp; Croydon Railway Company bought the canal for £40,250 and used the canal bed to construct part of the railway line between London Bridge and West Croydon.\n\n','',NULL,'2017-09-20 10:39:17','2017-09-20 10:48:58',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(721,21,'','Notes on the history of the Addiscombe Estate and the Addiscombe Military Academy:\nThe Addiscombe estate, on the Shirley Road (now the Addiscombe Road), was owned by the Heron family from the Tudor period. They built a very fine mansion on the site during Elizabeth I’s reign. Sir Nicholas Heron, who died in 1586, was interred in Heron\'s chapel in Croydon Parish Church.  After the death of the last of the Herons, the estate passed into other hands. \n\nIn 1700, the Addiscombe estate passed to William Draper, son-in-law of the Diarist, Sir John Evelyn. William demolished the old Elizabethan mansion and in 1702 built a new Palladian style mansion, “Addiscombe Place”. It was built to a design by Sir John Vanbrugh, architect of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard and was a prime example of the English Baroque style. This mansion stood on an area that is between the present-day Havelock and Outram Roads - on a site which is now the corner of Outram Road and Mulberry Lane. The largish brick and stone mansion consisted of a basement, 2 main storeys and an attic. The entrance was via a flight of steps which led into the great hall. Over the central windows of the front and above the attic was the inscription in Roman characters \"Non faciam vitio culpave minorem\" - \"I will not lower myself by vice or fault\".\n\nSir John Evelyn recorded in his diary \"I went to Adscomb on 11 July 1703 to see my son-in-law’s new house. It has excellent brickwork and Portland stone features, that I pronounced it good solid architecture, and one of the very best gentlemen\'s houses in Surrey.\"  William Draper died in 1718, leaving his estate to his son of the same name. After his death, the estate passed to a nephew, Charles Clark who he lived there until 1778. \n\nDistinguished guests who stayed at the mansion over the years included George III, William Pitt the Younger and Peter the Great of Russia. Peter the Great is reputed to have planted a cedar tree in Mulberry Lane to record his visit.  William Pitt the Younger, while Prime Minister, is said to have been riding home from a night of revelry at Addiscombe and to have been so inebriated that he failed to stop at a Toll Gate and was shot at by the Night Watchman!  By the end of the 18th century, Addiscombe Place was one of four great houses which then stood in the area, the others being Brickwood, Stroud Green House and Ashburton House (situated further along the road to Shirley, its estate separated from the Addiscombe estate by Ashburton Road). \n\nIn 1808, the estate was in the hands of Henry Delme Radcliff, a distant relative by marriage of the Clark family, who sold the estate to the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) for £15,500 plus £1,104.10/- for timber and standing trees.The HEIC wished to establish a seminary at Addiscombe to train cadets for their army. Initially the seminary took in 60 cadets but this number soon increased. The college eventually had 150 cadets at any one time and during the 52 years of its existence, some 3,600 students passed through its doors.  As a result of the increased number of cadets, some extra buildings were required and construction works continued over a number of years. At its height, the seminary comprised: the mansion, various barrack blocks, a drawing hall and a lecture hall, a hospital, a dining hall, bake-house, dairy, laundry, brew-house, various storerooms, a sand-modelling hall, a gymnasium, a fives and racquet court and a chapel.\n\nFor 52 years the seminary at Addiscombe trained officers for the HIEC. The  First War of Indian Independence of 1857 (sometimes referred to as the Indian Mutiny) led to the British government removing the HEIC from any role in the government of India and so ended its need for a private army. The British government at first thought to retain Addiscombe as a military college, but in the end it was decided that the training colleges at Woolwich and Sandhurst were adequate to meet the needs of the army. So, on 30 August 1861, by direction of the Secretary of State for India, Addiscombe College and grounds were sold by auction to the British Land Company for £33,600. The mansion, the barracks and most of the other buildings were demolished, and the land was laid out as 5 parallel roads on which large villa-type houses were built.\n\nThe roads were named: Canning, Outram, Clyde, Elgin and Havelock after HEIC Company officers. . Many materials from the College buildings were recycled and used in the building of the new villas.  Of the original College buildings only two  houses, formerly professors’ houses, \'Ashleigh\' and \'India\', on the corner of Clyde Road/Addiscombe Road and the former gymnasium on Havelock Road have survived - although 2 other houses did survive until the beginning of the 20th century. The gymnasium has fairly recently been converted into a number of flats.\n\nThe new roads were sold as building lots and restrictions were placed as to what sort of building could be constructed.  They had to be of a minimum value of £300 - £400 (a considerable sum for the time) and ensured that the area was developed as large villa-type family homes.  The target buyers were the new comfortable middle classes who were attracted to Croydon by its excellent transport links to London.  The East India Company had resisted the extension of the railway line to Addiscombe, but now that it had gone from the area, the line was quickly extended and Addiscombe Road Station was built on farmland which had previously been owned by the HEIC and opened in 1864 to serve the newly built houses. The station no longer exists but was situated to the north of the Lower Addiscombe Road, opposite the newly built Canning Road.\n\n\n','',NULL,'2017-09-20 11:00:18','2017-09-20 16:07:03',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(722,18,'','','By Unknown (Life time: Unknown, photo c1859) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons',NULL,'2017-09-21 09:49:49','2017-09-21 09:49:49',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','800px-Addiscombe_Seminary_photo_c.1859.jpg'),(723,18,'','','\"By B.Constable ([1]) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\" ',NULL,'2017-09-21 10:07:13','2017-09-21 10:07:13',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Anerley_Gardens.jpg'),(724,21,'','Croydon Common: In the parish of Croydon before the Enclosures of 1801, there were nearly 1500 acres of common, heath and waste land: Norwood: 830 acres; Croydon Heath: 340 acres; Shirley Heath: 300 acres; Broad Green with Thornton Heath: 20 acres\nThe location of Croydon Common: By the time the first Ordnance Survey maps of Croydon were produced in 1895, Croydon’s common had long disappeared.  Before then, the best available map showing all parts of the modern London Borough of Croydon had been produced by Rocque.  It covers the whole of Surrey, and shows in some detail the town of Croydon (now central Croydon) and what were then the separate villages or hamlets of Broad Green, Thornton Heath, Shirley, Coulsdon, etc.  On Rocque’s map of Croydon (part of his 1745 map of Surrey) Croydon’s extensive Common can be clearly seen. At the end of 18th century, Croydon consisted mainly of a line of buildings stretched along the turnpike road (now North End, High Street and South End) and up Pound Street (now George Street) as far as the Fair Field and the town Pound (where Norfolk House is now situated). \nCroydon Common and Cherry Orchard: By the 15th Century, a large area of Common Land which was used for grazing extended from Selhurst to Broad Green (E to W), and Whitehorse to Cherry Orchard Road (previously Cony Lane) (N to S). The Parish of Croydon employed a herdsman and charged rates appropriate to the animal (e.g. a horse or cow: 1/2d). In later centuries, a large cherry orchard covered the southern part of the common and extended north of the line of George Street and when the fruit was ripe, a Cherry Fair was held near where the NLA Tower now stands. Cony Lane was renamed Cherry Orchard Road as a result. \nEntry to Croydon Heath (or Croydon Common) was controlled by gates. \n•	Newgate stood near Spurgeon’s Chapel and the present Wellesley Road was called Newgate Lane, later becoming New Lane. \n•	Middleheath Gate stood near where St James\' church is now, and \n•	Cony Lane Gate stood at the junction of Cross Road and what is now Cherry Orchard Road (then called Cony Lane).\nIt is recorded that William Pitt the Younger, while Prime Minister, was riding home from a night of revelry at Addiscombe Place (later to become the East India Company’s Military Academy)  and to have been so inebriated that he failed to stop at a Toll Gate and was shot at by the Night Watchman!  \nThe Common and highwaymen: While having large areas of unfenced common land around the town was in many ways an advantage to the poorer inhabitants of Croydon and its surrounding villages who could use it to graze their animals and collect firewood, there was a downside in the fact that the commons were notoriously the haunt of highwaymen who preyed on the traffic along the coaching routes which centred on Croydon.\nSee the account in the online resource, Criminal Croydon: http://www.apaw71.dsl.pipex.com/PDFs/newcriminalcroydon.pdf\nThe countryside around Croydon provided both rich pickings and a refuge for highwaymen and smugglers. London Road was used by travellers passing south from London, and the robbers could hide in the Great North Wood. The hills of Addington and Sanderstead were full of hiding places for smugglers of brandy, tea, tobacco and Belgian lace. \nThe Jolly Sailor public house in South Norwood was the haunt of smugglers and highwaymen, according to an unnamed history book referenced in the Croydon Times Diamond Jubilee Souvenir Number from 1921. What actually happened there isn’t mentioned. However, the Lambeth Borough Police website says that smugglers with packhorses laden with contraband from the coast would make their way through Norwood to the capital. \nThe Catherine Wheel in Croydon High Street was one of the less reputable public houses in Croydon. According to an article by James Hodder in the Croydon Guardian originally published in the 1950s, it catered for pilgrims but also \'less innocent travellers\'. It was regularly visited by highwaymen who would steal the purses of fellow guests. The original inn stood where Coombe Street crosses the High Street and was pulled down in 1760, to be replaced by the New Inn. The pub has been known as the Crown and Pepper since 2001. \nTo some extent, however, the highwaymen became folk heroes  – in particular, Jerry Abershaw, known as The Laughing Highwayman, who was tried and sentenced to death for murder at Croydon assizes on 30th July 1795. At his Croydon trial he mimicked Judge Baron Pentryn and he laughed and joked with the large crowd which came to see him hanged,  keeping up an \"incessant conversation\" on the way to the gallows. At the gallows “he threw open his shirt and with a flower between his teeth kicked off his boots with a flourish, to disprove his mother’s prophecy that he would die with his boots on.” (Ref the Books of Addiscombe, by members of the Canning and Clyde Roads Residents Association, publ Halsgrove)\nDick Turpin is reputed to have had a safe house in Croydon, near Thornton Heath: see this from Wikipedia: “Until the arrival of the railway in 1862, Thornton Heath was focused on an area 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south west of the manor house, at the locality on the main Sussex road A23 known as Thornton Heath Pond. Between the manor house and Pond was an isolated farmhouse. Eventually it would become the site for the railway station and the main expansion hub. … In the 18th century, the farmhouse became known as Dick Turpin\'s cottage. … the most notorious of all highwaymen is said to have lived here as a guest of his aunt. The cottage was subsequently believed to have been in the possession of the infamous John Gilpin, subject of a ballad by Cowper.” \nEnclosures of the Croydon Commonlands: Under an Act of 1797, much of the open fields, commons, marshes, heath, waste land and woods in the parish of Croydon was enclosed.  Most of the land was divided into plots to be privately cultivated by its new owners, and some of it was subsequently leased to builders.  A map was produced in 1800 showing the boundaries of the plots, the names of some landowners, roads and some buildings.  It covers the whole of what was then the parish of Croydon (now the northern part of the London Borough of Croydon, excluding Addington, Sanderstead, Coulsdon and Purley).\nAccording to a booklet in the Croydon Borough Archives, written by Edward A Martin, not dated, enclosure of Croydon’s Common lands had been taking place from the reign of Henry III, under the Statute of Merton - although there are no definite data on the amount of land enclosed before the Act of 1797. The lands enclosed under the 1797 Act were allocated in 1801. They were valuable assets as building plots and gravel pits. Broad Green and Parson’s Mead were exempted from the Act, but they were later enclosed by a private Act brought in 1823, which however preserved the old turnpike roads of Whitehorse Road and Windmill Road. Although the Bill was opposed, on 19th July 1797 the Croydon Inclosure Act was passed. This refers to 2,200 acres (or thereabouts) of ‘Open and Common Fields and Common Meadows, Commons, Marshes, Heaths, Wastes and Commonable Woods, Lands and Grounds and in addition another 6,200 acres of ‘Inclosed lands and Grounds’. After a Second, and then in 1806 a Third, Act was passed, eventually all the ‘Inhabitants Commons’ were enclosed. This included 2,307 acres and 2 roods of land which had 5 or 6 years earlier been awarded by the Enclosure Commissioners ‘for ever hereinafter to be and remain Common for the use of the inhabitants of Croydon.’  The proceeds of the sale of this remnant were used to build a new Town Hall and Butter Market and to purchase land to enlarge the cemetery of St John the Baptist church.\nIn the words of a jingle popular at the time of the Enclosures:\n\n“The law condemns the man or woman\nWho steals the goose from off the common,\nBut lets the greater villain loose\nWho steals the common from the goose.”\n\n','',NULL,'2017-09-21 10:57:51','2017-09-21 13:05:43',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(725,18,'','','original in Croydon Museum.

It was decided that its area of operations should be within a radius of twenty-four miles round Charing Cross by far the larger number of schools being within a five miles radius, but schools were also founded in five more districts: at Hill Street in Croydon Old Town, at Gravesend, Brentford, Kingston, and Woolwich.\nThe objects of the Union were to encourage and assist those who taught in Ragged Schools and to help by small grants of money where advisable; to spread information about schools in existence and to promote the formation of new ones; to suggest plans for more efficient management of the schools and for instruction of the children of the poor in general; to visit the schools and observe progress; to encourage teachers\' meetings and Bible classes; and to assist the old as well as the young in the study of the Word of God.\nIn Croydon, the living conditions of the poor had deteriorated substantially during the 19th century, owing to an unprecedented population explosion. At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon had a population of 5,743 – but within 30 years this had more than doubled to 12,479. With the arrival of the Surrey Iron Railway in 1803, of a canal in 1809 and then the London and Croydon Railway in 1839, the population of Croydon continued to grow very quickly. By 1871 the population reached 56,123. In the centre of Croydon, overcrowding, poor sanitation and a continual round of typhoid epidemics led to the establishment in 1849 of a local Board of Health and the old Workhouse on Duppas Hill no longer being large enough to accommodate all the paupers, to the building of a new Workhouse in Queens Road in 1885. This later became the Mayday Hospital.The main slums of Croydon were found in the Old Town - what became known as ‘The Disreputable Triangle’: the little streets and alleys bounded by the High Street, Surrey Street and Crown Hill.\nThe 1851 census indicates that there was a Ragged School in Bell Yard at that time (Bell Yard was presumably at the back of the Bell pub (now The Dog and Bull) in Surrey Street).  But the school seems to have lacked  fixed premises until after the 1870 Education Act. Following the Act, in 1872, the Ragged School opened in permanent premises and was situated in Hill Street which used to run from Old Town up towards Duppas Hill. Here, the houses were built at right angles to the road. It was a method which enabled 19th century house-builders to cram as many houses as possible onto the smallest plot of land - irrespective of the overcrowding that it caused.\n\nArchives of the Ragged School: As far as I am aware, no records exist for the Ragged School before 1872 – yet children had certainly been taught at Ragged School classes in Croydon from 1846. There are three volumes of admission registers covering 1880 – 1906 and 1906 – 1921 (for post infants) and 1893 – 1912 for infants. There are the Head’s log books for the entire 1872 – 1921 period.  All this archival material may all be seen at the Local Studies Library in Croydon Main Library.\n\nThe Head’s logbooks are particularly interesting and it is possible to deduce from them some of the pathetic details of the lives of the very poor in the days before the Welfare State.  Some of the entries, particularly the early ones, show the stresses and strains placed upon the teachers by their pupils’ unruly behaviour and general reluctance to be educated!\nThe Head Teachers whose log books I looked at were:\n1. John Jones, Head of the Ragged School from its opening in August 1872 in its Hill Street incarnation. At his death, the Croydon Advertiser said that his success as Master of the school was due to the fact that he had lived among the poor and understood their ways. He served as Head for nearly ten years and was absent only once, when he broke his thigh; he subsequently had to run the school from a wheelchair. \nHis Logbooks don’t give much information on the curriculum followed by his pupils instead they concentrate on the misdeeds of the children, their truanting and unruly behaviour. Many of the children seem to have been passed continually between the few schools that catered for the poorest children (for example the Parish Church School, the Industrial School and the Truant School) - a sort of ‘pass the parcel’ as they were excluded from one for bad behaviour of one sort or another, turned up on the roll of another school - only to be excluded from that one and to fetch up again at the Ragged School.  There are many incidences recorded of distraught parents pleading with Mr Jones to take their children back into school. The children could start school very early – the school acted as a sort of crèche for the babies because this enabled the older children to come to school instead of having to stay home to look after the little ones.  It is interesting to see why the children left school: Some were withdrawn for ‘family reasons’ – usually to look after younger siblings or an ailing parent; some became sick (consumption, death, taken into hospital); many went into employment (e.g. Errand Boy, a few into agricultural work); one girl is noted ‘Adopted by a Lady’; one small boy was ‘removed until he is 5 years old, being delicate.’\nTruanting was rife, particularly around the times of the Races – Derby Day and the Oaks. In 1875 Mr Jones notes in his Logbook: ‘The Bath and West of England Show at Waddon kept us low this week’.\nOn Whit Monday Bank Holiday of 1875 he writes: The number present was so small that at noon (the children were) given a half holiday.’\nIn March 1876 he noted: ‘John Sarah and Chas Smith having been absent a month were reported and their names removed from the Register.’ This was only one of very many noted cases of unauthorised absence among the pupils.\nChildren were also regularly suspended for bad behaviour. For example, for ‘gross irregularity’ for ‘declining to come on Sundays’; \nThere are graphic accounts of the bad behaviour of some of the children. For example, one particularly badly behaved boy, Michael White, who was brought back to the school by his father after truanting, in Mr Jones words:\n‘..threw himself upon the floor and plunged and kicked for some time so no one could approach him and having somewhat tired himself he rose to run out but was intercepted by his father and the Assistant and a Monitor, but he struck out and kicked so violently and so suddenly that he managed to get out and not having returned since, his case was sent to the School Board to deal with.’\nNonetheless, Mr Jones\' evident commitment to his pupils shines through – he does not give up on them, even when faced with inveterate truants. One case in particular shows the lengths he was prepared to go to to help the children in his care.\nIn 1876, he writes about the case of one William MacDonald (or Deeling), a persistent truant. William was, as was usual, passed around between various schools before being sent to the Poor Law Union District School in Anerley. Opened in 1850, this residential school was considered exemplary in its time, but despite all the apparent advantages offered to the children in its care, William MacDonald was seemingly unimpressed and absconded, only to be caught by the police and returned to the school. He took himself off again and finally Mr Jones writes to a Lt Col Addington of the One Hundredth Regiment of Foot, which was William’s father’s regiment, and “...begged him to take the boy into the Regimental Band.” Lt Col Addington “acquiesced” and Mr Jones in his own words, taken from the school logbook, then “...applied to the Guardians (who had the boy in the Union) asking for him and for the means to covey him to Aldershot, which was granted and in 20th September 1876 he was taken to Aldershot by W Jones.”\nIt would be good to know what became of William, whether the discipline of the army was able to prevent his taking himself off again and what sort of a career he may have had. The dedication of his Headmaster was not in question.\nThe children of the Ragged School were often the objects of considerable amounts of charity from the better-off residents of Croydon. For example, they were taken on an annual Treat in August to Purley Downs; on Good Friday in 1875 ‘all the children had a bun and a book’; there was an annual Sunday School Treat in January; on Good Friday of 1878 ‘each child received …. an illustrated tract’; a Dr Carpenter gave an annual Treat in August.\nThe staff were not neglected, as the Ragged School Union held an annual Treat for them in Trent Park, Barnet, the seat of the Treasurer of the Ragged School Union, although Mr Jones notes that on 21st July 1877 ‘only about 200 teachers were present’.\nAppeals were often made by Mr Jones for relief help for the poorest children. For example, on 12 March 1875 he notes:\n‘A number of the children having been found very poorly clad, an appeal was made through the newspaper for help – several kind friends sent various articles of clothing and the Dorcas Society of Addiscombe a quantity of new frocks, petticoats and co.  Nearly 80 useful articles were distributed during this week.’\nIn April 1875 he notes: ‘During the past 3 months, when the dining kitchen at the British Workman was open, a large number of dinners were given to the most hungry of the children.’\nIn 1877, Mr Jones’ Logbook recorded that “...attendance was somewhat lower owing to bad weather and bad boots.”\nMr Jones again used the columns of the Croydon Guardian to plead his children’s case when, on 19th December 1877, we find him writing, “Please spare me a corner in your next issue, for I am greatly in need of help.”  He goes on to say that he has held off from highlighting the needs of his children because there had recently been “so many appeals for one object or another”, but that he can do so no longer because of the “many sad cases of privation and suffering.” He goes on to say that “relief of any kind – cast-off clothing, shoes, and a little money for food and repairing shoes – will be cheerfully sent for and gratefully acknowledged.”\nThe charitable donations continue throughout the time that Mr Jones was Headmaster.  For example in December 1884, he notes that “Bread and jam (was)  ...given to 60 children who had no dinner at home.” \nHowever, not all Croydon residents were so generous spirited!  There is a letter in the archives of the Croydon Guardian from ‘An aggrieved Parishioner’ which bemoans the fact that:\n“Night after night the outlying villa residents of your expanded town are worried by howling urchins who affect to be choristers and expect payment for their intruded discord …” the letter concludes with an appeal to the Editor to “...stir up the police to stop all such so-called Christmas carol-singing, a profane and scandalous form of beggary…”   and to the clergy to “interdict to their schools and choirs all such peripatetic impertinences.”\nThe Ragged School was regularly inspected throughout this period both by an Inspector from the School Board, a Mr Barrow Rule and by an Inspector from the Ragged School Union, Mr Hytche. Their visits are recorded in the Logbook but not much is said about what they reported or what the children were studying. \n\n2. Matilda Burgess\nJohn Jones was succeeded in August 1882 by Matilda Burgess, who remained as Head Teacher until 1892. \nIt is interesting to note the very different tenor of her Logbook compared with that of Mr Jones. Her handwriting is neat and precise, whereas his had been somewhat of a scrawl and she records in detail the curriculum studied and transcribes Inspectors’ reports.  She also records the weekly average attendance. \nUnlike Mr Jones, Matilda Burgess was a ‘Certified’ Teacher.  She was shocked by the poor attainment levels of her pupils when she took over the school in 1882, writing in the Logbook, “The attainments of the scholars are very low. Three fourths of the children must for the present be placed in Standard 1.  One half do not know their alphabet.”\nShe seems to have taken the behaviour of the children in hand and after just one week in post she notes: “...the order  ...is somewhat better...” and “...stone throwing has subsided.” \nThe Report of the Government Inspector of October 1882 noted: “The school has only recently been placed under a Certified Teacher. Considering the Class of children and their backward condition hitherto, those presented have passed a fairly promising examination, but there is a very large proportion of scholars who are extremely ignorant.  Order is understood to be much improved on what it was until recently, but there is still great room for amendment.”  \n42 children had been presented for examination, with 36 passes in Reading, 38 in Writing and 31 in Arithmetic. With payment by results, the poor attainment of the children was a considerable concern – particularly as the achievement of the Infant classes was found to be so poor that “My Lords are unable to allow any Grant at all on behalf of the Infants.” \nFrom now on, we learn from the school Logbooks much more about the curriculum and the examination results and much less about the children’s behaviour. The distribution of food and clothing continues, however.  For instance, Matilda Burgess notes that there is a ‘Shoe Club’. A Mr WV Arnold makes several visits and requests that the children be provided with soap and ‘blacking brushes’.\nHowever, Matilda Burgess, who arrived with so much energy and hope in 1882, was forced out in 1892, seemingly as a result of the Free Education Act of 1891 after which the school Management Committee decided to close the school.\nThe situation caused understandable anguish to Matilda Burgess. In her Logbook she wrote on 31st October 1891,\n“The effect of the Free Education Act upon this school is as follows: At the outset there was a sudden and heavy declention (sic) in numbers.  An unfounded rumour had circulated to the effect that this school would be closed as a direct consequence of the working of the Act and this added materially to the disastrous result upon attendance produced by the freeing of the School Boards.”\nIt has to be said that Matilda’s distress is visible in her handwriting which changes from a beautifully written hand to almost a scrawl.  The rumour turned out not after all to be ‘unfounded’ and the staff was given notice in December 1891.\n\nHowever, the Ragged School did continue to function, although under different management, as shown in the following account found at Ref: Cox, R (1993). More on the Ragged School, Bull Croydon Nat Hist Sci Soc, 94: 5.\n\'The Infants were now separated from the rest of the school, a Mrs Pond being given charge of the Infants and her husband, Thomas Edward, the remainder. But, after a further decade, Mrs Pond had a breakdown and Mr Pond assumed control of the entire school. It was a small school, the average attendance in 1903-04 being 35 Infants and 64 (post-Infants).\nBy 1906 the name Ragged School had been dropped and it became known as St Andrew\'s (Old Town) School, distinguishing it thereby from St Andrew\'s (CE) School in Southbridge Road. Pond remained as Head until 1913. At that point the Senior children went off to the nearby St Andrew\'s Girls and Boys Upper Schools and the Old Town School Head Teacher, Gladys Wilson, had charge only of Infants and Juniors. About 1920 the Juniors went, too.\nIn 1921 Mary Large the Head Teacher of St Andrew\'s (CE) Infants School retired (she died 15 years later and has a brass plate in the South Chapel of St Andrew\'s Church) and St Andrew\'s (Old Town) Infants School finally closed.\'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n','',NULL,'2017-09-21 14:57:19','2017-09-22 15:00:10',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(727,21,'','Although the ancient buildings of the \'Disreputable Triangle\' were quite picturesque, they were finally demolished in a sweeping programme of slum clearance in 1891. JO Pelton, author of Relics of Old Croydon (publ 1891) wrote of this area as ‘…neglected and squalid, the playground of dirty children, the lounge of idle and disreputable men and women…’\n\nSome people were sad to see the demolition of the old houses. John Ruskin, whose maternal grandmother had been the landlady of the King’s Head in King Street, wrote sentimentally of his memories of the area and of his longing for ‘…things modest, humble and pure in peace, under the low red roofs of Croydon, and by the cress set rivulets in which the sand danced and minnows darted, above the springs of Wandel.’ (Praeterita, 1891)\n\nBut the idyllic days Ruskin recalled were long gone and the enormous explosion of Croydon\'s population in the first half of 19th century had brought overcrowding and slum conditions to the town centre. At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon had a population of 5,743 – but within 30 years this had more than doubled to 12,479. With the arrival of the Surrey Iron Railway in 1803, of a canal in 1809 and then the London and Croydon Railway in 1839, the population of Croydon continued to grow very quickly.

Middle Row didn\'t cover a very large area, and consisted of a network of narrow streets and alleys ...  which lay in a triangle, bordered by Surrey Street, Crown Hill and Croydon\'s High Street. \nSome of the properties were houses, which sometimes had more than a dozen people living in them.

In that year Mr. David Hodgson (who had previously been a local preacher in one of our Lincolnshire Circuits) approached the March Quarterly Meeting of the London Circuit, held at Elim Chapel, Fetter Lane, and Croydon was immediately missioned.\nCroydon Old Town appears on a plan still in possession of Rev. Joel Hodgson, who had the honour of taking the first class-book to Croydon, and at the following June Quarterly Meeting there were reported five full members and three on trial. The Rev. J. Ride was sent to reconnoitre, and he gave a deplorable account of the vice and Sabbath-breaking prevalent in Croydon. The Old Town was spoken of as ‘a hell upon earth,’ and it proved a very difficult mission. The Rev. George Wood was located in the town, but his stay was brief. From the first great opposition was given, and the meetings were broken up, sometimes twice during the hour. Men under the influence of drink often mobbed the missioners, tearing off their clothes and throwing all kinds of missiles. But these early Primitives were men of grit and not easily thwarted. Still they sang through the streets the familiar refrains:\n‘Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,’\nand\n‘Turn to the Lord and seek salvation.’\nOn one occasion the clergyman sent a man to forbid a camp-meeting, and as the preachers appointed had not a preacher’s license, it was thought prudent not to proceed. All sorts of disturbances were made indoors. A ‘survivor’ remembers a donkey used to distract the meeting, birds were let loose, and songs sung, not exactly of a religious character. Yet the power of God was manifested, many conversions took place, and the whole little band grew. One man, anxious for the truth, though not daring to enter the building for fear of persecution from the family, climbed a ladder and listened at the window. It was to him a Jacob’s ladder, which brought the saving ministry of Heaven. As he testified afterwards, ‘blessed truths I used to hear on that ladder.’\nIt is evident persecution assumed a serious form, and was referred to the General Missionary Committee, who wrote as follows in 1849 - ‘The brethren at Croydon are desired to bear up patiently under persecution, and Brother Ride is specially requested to desire them to do so, as a prosecution might involve them in serious difficulties.’ That letter was signed by W. Garner as secretary.\nIn that year Croydon became a separate mission, under the direction of the General Missionary Committee. The population of the town was about 20,000. The accompanying illustration shows the first regular preaching-room, and still exists, though the front has been recently rebuilt. Mighty rivers have their humble sources; great harvests spring from smallest seeds; so from this first preaching-room have arisen church after church, and even whole circuits.”\n','Account taken from Methodist website at:  http://www.myprimitivemethodists.org.uk/page/croydon_circuit_london',NULL,'2017-09-23 08:03:40','2017-09-23 08:03:40',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(729,18,'','',' http://www.myprimitivemethodists.org.uk/page/croydon_circuit_london',NULL,'2017-09-23 08:09:11','2017-09-23 08:09:11',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','old town.jpg'),(730,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-09-23 14:42:13','2017-09-23 14:42:13',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','1820 Ben Blackmore.jpg'),(731,18,'','','Original in Croydon Museum',NULL,'2017-09-24 17:49:39','2017-09-24 17:49:39',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','dick turpins cottage thornton heath.jpg'),(732,21,'','A fair in Hyde Park, 1814\n\nThis account probably refers to when (cf Wikipedia) “Hyde Park hosted a Great Fair in the summer of 1814 to celebrate the Allied sovereigns\' visit to England, and exhibited various stalls and shows. The Battle of Trafalgar was re-enacted on the Serpentine, with a band playing the National Anthem while the French fleet sank into the lake.” This was referred to as “NAUMACHIA”.\n\nJohn Sterling’s account from his Memoir – the punctuation is John’s own!\n“About this time, all foreign princes were in London and the Countess had issued strict orders that none of the servants were, under pain of her displeasure, to visit London, for fear of accidents.  Twas this very order, I suppose, that stirred up the spirit of opposition in me and determined me to go: for I thought so grand a sight would not come every year, and if I lost one Countess’ favour, I might get another, but a fair in Hyde Park might never come!\n\nSo, go I did, though I did not attempt to leave Stanmore till all had retired to rest, not having acquainted anyone with my intent, and meaning to return before anyone was up. I got into the midst of the sight about two o’clock in the morning and found opportunity enough to put into practice some of the accomplishments acquired at my Bath College: the Pig and Whistle. (This refers to some earlier adventures in Bath where John regularly over-indulged at the Pig and Whistle!)\n\nAbout four in the morning, just as I was preparing to return, my attention was (taken?) by a noise in one of the tents that seemed what I called “a spree”, and always ready for that, I entered, when I saw a poor fellow in the hands of two or three watchmen.  But with his clothes so torn, his face so disfigured and every way bearing such evident signs of having been pretty well mauled, that I determined to assist the weaker party, and on going closer to him, he immediately said, ”John, assist me!  Get me out of the hands of these Devils!”\n\nI then discovered that he was one of my fellow servants from Stanmore, who, like myself, had determined to gratify himself on the sly, at the risk of place.  I offered five shillings to his detainers.  They refused, saying they would make ten of him before they were done!  Determined to try the argument of force since the more acceptable one of money had no power, my fists soon found their way to the heads of one of the Charleys, but, it being rather more thick than I calculated upon, I was several times obliged to repeat the blows ere I made an impression.  When, just as I was about to conquer and had got my companion from the enemy, I was felled by the bludgeon of one of the assistant Charleys.\n\nOn recovering my perception, I found I had, along with my fellow servant, been taken to the Watch house twas some comfort to have a fellow sufferer.  In the morning, we were taken before a Magistrate, and after he had listened with becoming gravity to all the lies the Charleys were pleased and so well qualified to tell him, he fined us five shillings each.  When we were fined by this excellent judge for being drunk, when we were as sober, or more so, than ever any judge or magistrate that ever sat on the Bench!\n\nOn our way to Stratford Place, where we were going to see a friend of mine in Lord Brunswick’s family, I enquired of Tom how the deuce he got himself into the row.     “Why,” says Tom, “I took it into my head to do the civil thing to a nice woman who I sat talking to and joking with, when up came a fellow and claimed her as his wife!  Though his head looked thick enough to have more horns than I could ever plant there, he seemed mightily afraid of having it so adorned!  I reasoned with the fellow and told him there was no harm in a little chat.  He swore I had no business to talk to his wife, I swore I had, and so we got from words to blows: there it began, you know!”\n\n\nLess scurrilous contemporary accounts can be found at: https://pastnow.wordpress.com/2014/08/01/august-1-1814-grand-jubilee/\n\nThey include this description of the occasion written by Thomas Smith (of Mary-le-bone) in his Historical Recollections of Hyde Park: \n\n“The entertainments in Hyde Park although of a different description, were not the less interesting, the whole space being converted into an extensive fair; between 400 and 500 booths were erected, where every delicacy that could please the eye or suit the taste of the most fastidious gourmand might be obtained. The liberty of the press was here also proudly recognised, a number of printing presses being set up, whence issued with great rapidity engraved views of the Temple, Pagoda, &amp;c. and random records of great variety, which were eagerly purchased by the visitors as mementos of the pleasureable sensations they experienced. Many shows and theatres were also to be seen where the heroes of the sock and buskin, afforded infinite amusement to His Majesty’s lieges. Unusual anxiety was however evinced to witness a mimic naval engagement on the Serpentine river; this splendid sheet of water, presented the singular spectacle of two hostile fleets, vix. an English and American, riding in proud defiance on its bosom, both shores being lined with a dense mass of people assembled to witness this novel scene. About six o’clock the action commenced by a cannonading by the ships in the van of the opposing fleets, until the whole line gradually neared each other; after a severe struggle the Americans were ultimately driven on shore; at dark, however, the British line formed and bore down upon the American fleet then lying at anchor, and set fire to the whole of their ships which were burnt to the water’s edge. The effect of this conflagration was surprizingly magnificent, indeed the whole of this exhibition was calculated to afford infinite gratification to the middling and lower classes of a maritime nation like Great Britain. The entertainment terminated at this point by a display of fire-works, among which the water-rockets, a new species of combustible, attracted much notice.\nThis day all business appeared to have been suspended in London and the suburbs, and John Bull, Mrs. Bull, and their numerous progeny, seemed to have thrown themselves with perfect good humour into the vortex of public rejoicing and festivity, and in spite of the eccentricities of his nature, gave vent to feelings and expressions of joy and gladness, at the restoration of peace and harmony to his native land.\nThe fair was allowed to continue during the whole of the week; the park being cleared by order of the Secretary of State on Monday the 8th, and such was the injury done to this beautiful spot by the influx of so many visitors, that a lapse of two years passed away ere it recovered its pristine beauty.”\n','https://pastnow.wordpress.com/2014/08/01/august-1-1814-grand-jubilee/',NULL,'2017-09-25 09:20:13','2017-09-25 09:20:13',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(733,18,'','','Image available online from British Museum website: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3202045&partId=1',NULL,'2017-09-25 09:26:13','2017-09-25 09:26:13',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','jubilee celebrations in Hyde Park.jpg'),(734,21,'','Dalston 1908, a vibrant and affluent community, a short “hackney” ride from the City, where Prussian émigré Clara Ludski, who lived with her cabinet maker husband Walter on Sandringham Road, realised the growing business potential of “moving pictures” and employed local young architect W. E. Trent, who later went on to specialise in cinema design and became the in house architect for Provincial Cinematograph Theatres and later Gaumont, to plan the conversion of her auction room at 105 Kingsland High Street into a 175-seat “electric picture house”. \nThe design was like many early shop conversions with a screen behind the on-street pay box and a projection box built on to the rear of the building reached by a ladder from the outside yard. The cinema was entered from the left of the screen and exited from the right. It was called the Kingsland Palace and was among the first full-time cinemas in London.\nIt opened officially on June 28th 1909, and records show it as “occupied for animated picture shows, with illuminated letters spelling KINGSLAND PALACE onto the High St”. \nThe 1910 Cinematograph Act caused many of these small shop conversion cinemas to close, as it required that the projection room be separate to the auditorium for fire safety and for there to be a suitable entrance and separate exit from the auditorium. With foresight or because he was aware of the new legislation, Trent gave the Palace a separate brick box attached to the rear of the building to accommodate the projector, the flammable nitrate film stock and the projectionist.\n\n“The Palace was an immediate success in its day. Hackney’s working class, priced out of theatre visits and with poor transport links to the West End, flocked to the cinemas and music halls of the area..

The Empire was a huge architectural statement on the High Street with its huge dome and 2 storey arched window and ornate classical exterior. It was also equipped with a luxurious tea room, but otherwise had very little lobby space, and partons had to queue outside for tickets.\nThe Kingsland Empire opened to great acclaim on April 29th 1915.\nBy 1914 there were over 5000 cinemas operating in the UK, and the advent of WW1 impacted them in terms of propaganda, cinemas as well as providing entertainment, warmth and luxurious surroundings, also became the place to see news reel footage of the war, and at the same time film moved from being cheap and sensational entertainment in short format (around 25 minutes), to larger epic 2 hour + productions like Birth Of A Nation (1915). \nLord Kitchener, then the Secretary of State for War initially decided to ban film and photography on the battlefield but relented and UK cinemas saw a wave of patriotic films and tough battle footage including the epic film Battle of the Somme (1916), which bought home the horror of war. Other effects of WW1 on cinemas were staffing and the loss of skilled projectionists and musicians, and the introduction of a levy on cinema tickets to fund the war effort Audiences themselves visited the cinema in fear of catching infections (influenza) and of being killed by bombs, but overall it was a boom time for cinema going. The Kingsland Empire was able to use its large basement area as a shelter for customers and local residents when bombing raids took place, and even advertised that it was “Zeppelin proof”, the nearest hits being in Stoke Newington and Shoreditch.\nIn 1920 a Kimball cinema organ was added to replace the piano and small orchestra, and probably to compete with the new luxury Dalston Picture House which opened nearby on 6th December 1920 with 2157 seats and a grand tearoom and extensive lounge facilities, it was billed as the Europe’s first Super Cinema and was a huge success - no doubt taking trade away from the Empire.\nTo keep up with cinema trends in 1929 sound was installed with the arrival of talking pictures. The Empire continued to be a great success but due to failing health Clara sold the lease in 1934 (although the family retained the freehold on the cinema until the late 60’s), to London and Southern Super Cinemas who were shortly after that acquired by Classic Cinema Group. \nIn 1936 London County Council inspected the Empire and found it had insufficient ventilation and inadequate waiting areas, in short the 21 year old building was cramped and very dated when compared to the new ABC Savoy which was under construction five minutes walk up the high street, with 1890 seats in luxurious art deco splendour and modern heating, sound and wide screen picture, and most importantly large lounge areas that meant people could queue inside in the warmth. The Savoy opened with great fanfare on 26th October 1936.  \nAnd so new owners Classic decided to rebuild the Empire to solve the operational issues and to up its game in terms of modern luxury and so it closed its mahogany Edwardian doors for the last time in Nov 1936 for complete reconstruction.\nEmploying the extraordinary talents of F.E. Bromide, the Empire was externally stripped of all classical detailing, its huge dome was removed, and a new cinema was built within the existing walls and roof, but the new trend in wide screen films demanded wider and less vertiginous auditoriums, and so the new curved art deco ceiling effectively cut the Empire’s circle in two leaving the original ornate auditorium plasterwork and domed ceiling timbers out of view but relatively untouched, as they remain to this day.\nTaking a year to reconstruct, the new Classic Cinema Dalston with 567 luxurious seats and standing room for another 110, opened on  18th December 1937. \nThe Ideal Kinema records that “the exterior was streamlined into a fluted curved corner over the entrance with a massive 33 foot high metal sign lit by neon tubes advertising the building to Kingsland High Street. The interior was decorated \"in a modern style with sweeping lines, and the colouring is in a grey-blue and warm brown, and the seating a dark red, which is set off by red festoon tabs\".\nElain Harwood of English Heritage and the Cinematograph Theatre Association wrote (in 1994 prior to the exterior renovation):\n\"It remains a remarkable work by F E Bromige, and the only one of his four surviving interiors in undivided cinema use. Bromige is an important if obscure cinema architect best known for his work in north-west London for the Hammond Dawes circuit. There he designed a number of bizarrely curvaceous cinemas, which may be considered a bridging point where the extremes of Art Deco and moderne styles meet. His buildings are simple, but make effective use of good proportions that expunge the need for superficial decoration. The best survivor is the Grosvenor, Rayner\'s Lane, listed Grade II* and now a themed bar and restaurant. Of the two other survivors, one has been gutted and subdivided into several uses and the other is a bingo hall.\nConstricted as he was by the existing shell, Bromige nevertheless achieves the same series of sweeping curves at the Rio, the cash-register shape of the proscenium wall complementing the sweep of the deeply curved circle. A little moulding on the side walls is all such curves need for further amplification. The exterior is less successful, particularly since a reduction in the parapets in 1944 for safety reasons meant that Bromige\'s sequence of flying ribs round the corner of the street frontage went too. (These were partially reconstructed at a slightly lower level in the 1997 exterior renovation.) The drum over the foyer that remains the chief interest of the building has some ridged effects; but it must be recognised that most of the decoration on the outside was achieved by lettering and neon lighting, and these have now gone. There is no doubt that the Rio is a fine cinema building, and that it exhibits the two chief phases of cinema design in Britain with extraordinary clarity.\"\n\nIt looked like no other cinema in London with its spectacular neon signage, and was advertised as a super-cinema in miniature. At the time luxury super-cinemas were very popular and large ones were springing up in the area: the next door Savoy, two new Odeon’s (Dalston and Hackney Rd), the Ritz Clapton, the Regal in Mare St and the huge Regent in Stamford Hill. \nEven as the new paint was drying the threat of war loomed over every aspect of daily life, the 1915 Adams and Coles plans had made provision for an air raid shelter against Zeppelin attacks, and in 1940 the basement was again put to such a use as a community air-raid shelter - though apparently only after the evening performance was over.\nThe Classic thrived during the war years as a much-needed place of entertainment and also somewhere to see the latest Pathe newsreel.\nWhile the building largely survived the numerous bombing raids on East London, an incendiary bomb landed in Birbeck Mews across the road (the 1960’s Post Office now fills this gap in the high street) destroying the shops opposite the cinema, and the blast took out the neon and the glass and metal sign that dominated the front of the Classic. By the end of the war the building was looking very shabby as did the rest of London, but due to a shortage of building materials, it did not receive a tidy up until 1950, when the vertical blade sign was replaced with a horizontal CLASSIC sign across the top of the building, and a simplified neon scheme was reinstalled.\nAs TV dramatically pulled audiences away from cinemas from 1950 onwards, they began to close in large numbers, the Stoke Newington Vogue (also run by Classic) closed in 1958, the Dalston Plaza shut in 1959, and in November 1960 the nearby historic Circus/Picture House/Gaumont became the first large competitor to close.\nAs ever the Classic adapted to survive, being smaller, more modern and more compact, it was also cheaper to run and easier to fill than the huge 2000+ seat giants nearby.\nIts first reincarnation was as the Classic Cartoon Cinema – billed as “The Greatest Little Show On Earth” it opened on Saturday 24 May 1958, each programme featured 5 cartoons (Tom &amp; Jerry, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny etc) plus a weekly adventure serial and short films on themes like travel and nature. This lasted just over 18 months, then with the closure of some of the nearby competition, Classic invested in a full refurbishment with as the advert said “New seating, heating &amp; ventilation, décor and projection equipment” also for the first time seats could be booked in advance. This took place over Christmas in 1959, and the newly updated Classic Continental opened on Sunday 3 January 1960 just in time to welcome the swinging sixties. \nThe new programme featured the best of European arthouse cinema. The post war austerity years were over and London was enjoying an economic boom, the middle classes were affluent and their children were receiving a better education and access to Universities, and there was a growing interest in French and Italian cinema.\nThe Classic Continental Dalston was a huge success with its newly refurbished luxury interior, and it picked up business as its competitors continued to close. The nearby Odeon on Hackney Road became the first Odeon to convert to bingo – a new craze that was to sweep the nation and an ideal use to fill large (empty) cinema buildings.\nBy the late 60’s the programme at the Classic covered a wide range of films but had moved to programme mostly Hollywood titles, so the “Continental” title was quietly dropped, and it became the Classic Dalston once again and remained this way until 1970.\n\nThe steep downward trend in cinema going that had lasted for 20 years continued and so investment in film and cinemas declined as well. Cinema going was not an altogether pleasant experience with many poorly maintained cinemas and a particular low point in film making quality. It was not until 1976 with the arrival of Jaws and Star Wars that the beginning of a reversal in fortunes started, but it was not until the mid 80s with the arrival of the first multiplex cinemas and a new generation of blockbuster family films that the decline in UK cinema admissions was halted.\nAt the Classic Dalston audiences had declined and a new marketing plan was needed - what happened was quite radical. A relaxation in censorship laws allowed cinema clubs to show uncensored films to an adult audience. This lead to a rapid spread of hardcore porn cinemas, most of which were independent, however a chain was set up under the Tatler brand (owned and operated by Classic - although the name Tatler had its origins as news theatres) and Dalston was once again spruced up, this time with a pale pink colour scheme internally, and a lurid purple and pink auditorium. The stage was also enlarged and for the first time, the cinema operated as cine variety, which could otherwise be described as an “adult porno striptease burlesque” house.\nUncensored sexploitation films were shown as double bills and inbetween the features, strippers took to the stage.\nThe Dalston Tatler Cinema Club, opened on 3rd May 1970 with Hotspur and Motel Wives, the Hackney Gazette records that a “leggy girl” was seen in the vicinity promoting membership at £1 a year, with admission at 8/- (40p) and business boomed, a current Rio customer who remember the Tatler days describes it as not being as grubby as it sounds, and it was frequented by couples rather than the usual image of single men in raincoats. By August 1971 conventional features ran thur/fri/sat which gave the cinema a very difficult image to portray to the cinema going public, and many parents refused to let their children go unaccompanied to the Saturday morning children’s club.\nThrough the 70’s the mix of films kept changing to match peoples tastes. Late night X rated horror films were introduced, and the striptease moved to just Thursdays but with bigger name artists and presented as a full Vegas style stage show, the admission price had climbed to 60p by this point. \nHowever tastes changed once again and the local audience in Dalston grew tired of porn and preferred to view it on VHS as the price of machines had fallen enough to make ownership affordable, and the high street began to see VHS rental shops opening, although the Astra cinema further up the road picked up what remained of this audience and itself became a cinema club showing uncensored porn and martial arts films.\nSo the Tatler signage came down and the cinema reverted to being the Classic Cinema Dalston with a new blue colour scheme externally, from early 1975.\nThen in early in 1976 Classic announced that it was looking for another operator to take over the lease at Dalston as they were no longer interested in running it at a loss, the other option was permanent closure and demolition. \nThis created a huge ground swell of local public interest in keeping the cinema open, initially the lease was acquired by local businessman Paul Theodorou , and he took over the cinema renaming it the Rio in April 1976, the reopening film was Charro starring Elvis Presley, but he struggled to attract a consistent audience to the cinema in spite of showing a mix of recent hits, Elvis seasons, westerns, Kung-fu, horror and Turkish films – as there was a growing local Greek Cypriot and Turkish community. The cinema limped on through the long hot summer of 1976 but by the end of the year he admitted defeat and handed it over to a working group of local residents in February 1977, this group were made up of people linked to the Centreprise bookshop which was located opposite the cinema.\nAt this time ABC who probably had the same long term view of the area as Classic, threw in the towel on the huge Savoy (which had curiously never been subdivided), and an independent operator took over and on March 12th 1977 it became the Konak, which screened recent blockbusters and Bollywood cinema.\nThe same month the Rio Cinema Working Party approached the Arts Council, the Greater London Council, the British Film Institute and Hackney Borough Council to apply for funds to buy the building. They planned to develop the Rio into a centre for dance, drama, music hall, poetry and music, with film, video and photography workshops in the basement.\nThe GLC and Hackney Council agreed to finance the purchase of the sub-lease, and made the Working Party managers of the building in March 1979. The plans for a multi-purpose arts centre were found to be over-ambitious. The Working Party was replaced by a new Management Committee, elected from the membership, who decided to concentrate the Rio\'s activities on the visual media of film, video and photography. The Rio became a not for profit company, limited by guarantee and a registered charity. Elected Committee members were not only directors of the company but also trustees of the charity. \nThis management structure continues today, although the Management Committee has been renamed the Board of Directors to fully reflect its responsibilities.\nThe official relaunch happened in April 1979, a time which also saw the closure of the nearby Dalston Odeon, leaving only the Rio and the nearby Konak and Astra as the three survivors from a total of 23 cinemas spread along the Kingsland road.\nThe 80’s – “The 1980s is a fascinating time because it has shaped the economy, society and culture ever since and, for good or ill, rendered what came before obsolete. For the British film industry the bulk of the decade saw cinema at an all-time low, to the point where some doubted whether it had a future in this country at all. By the end of the decade however the seeds of hope had begun to bear fruit and the start of the film revolution for audiences was upon us.” BFI\nThatcher swept to power in May 1979 and started to radically alter the economic, political and cultural face to life in the UK, a policy of deregulation, opening up competition and privatisation changed the UK from a society based on collective solutions and state control to one of free enterprise. In doing so the country became hugely divided between those with “loads a money” and those who had none, and Hackney fell very firmly into the latter.\nThe Rio became a champion of independent cinema, cult movies, and several groups contributed to the programme so that the cinema appealed to a wide range of groups – film fans, families, womens cinema, Turkish film fans, Bollywood, mums (a crèche was set up), the unemployed, classic Hollywood – the programme literally covered everything, a truly community cinema.\nThe Rio also acted as an extension of the Centreprise bookshop, allowing the various groups involved to have use of the spaces within the building as meeting rooms, photographic workshops, with a full darkroom, a basement screening room equipped with VHS, 16mm and Super 8 projection, a café, community drop in advice days and its own news and graphics department which produced a weekly news reel slide show and audio commentary that played before the films. This extensive photography archive still exists at the Rio providing a unique record of life in Dalston through the 80’s, and will hopefully in the near future, fulfil its initial ambition of being an accessible archive for the local community.\nWhile the Rio was a highly used public space,in July 1983 the Astra finally closed due to dwindling audiences (for conversion into a mosque) and then on Feb 16th 1984 the Ace (former ABC/Savoy/Konak) finally gave up, the manager blaming rampant unemployment in the area and the rising video rental market and especially video piracy. On the closing day of the Ace, their house cat Queenie was handed over to the Rio staff, where she lived out a very pampered and sedentary life terrorising the mice and customers alike., known as the Rio Prowler she would leap unannounced into customers laps during the film in the hope of somewhere warm to sleep or to gain a morsel of food.\nIronically if the Rio had remained as a Classic it would have passed through various name changes as the Classic group changed hands, to  become first a Cannon, then an MGM, then a Virgin and then an ABC and finally an Odeon! – however the Rio’s fortunes went in a very different direction to the commercial cinema chains.\nBy 1995, the Rio was badly in need of extensive refurbishment, not only to the décor but also to essential items like the wiring, heating and roof, and an application was made to the Arts Council of England for a Lottery grant. \nThis was eventually approved in 1997 and architects Burrell, Foley, Fischer, whose previous projects included the Stratford Picture House, were commissioned to undertake the redesign. \nGreat pains were taken to retain Bromige’s original Art Deco design in the auditorium, down to matching the original paint colours and lighting features. The work began in early 1999 and the cinema reopened in August of that year. During the refurbishment English Heritage stepped in over their concerns about the extent of the work being done but they eventually approved the changes and following completion the Rio was awarded Grade II listed status. \nThe major structural work involved changing the rake of the auditorium, restoring some of the exterior art deco details, reducing the size of the rear stalls slightly to accommodate an enlarged foyer, improved acoustics and the integration of the café space as part of the lobby. Among the many other improvements were new stalls seats, custom-designed leopard print carpeting throughout, air conditioning and the installation of a Dolby Digital™ sound system.\nDuring the closure for building work, the Rio screenings and programme took up temporary residence down the road at the Lux Cinema in Hoxton Square.\nFollowing the refurbishment, the Rio saw a big increase in audiences as the area began to attract a younger art crowd, drawn to the East End by its cheap and plentiful studio and warehouse spaces, and its emerging nightime scene.\nIn 2007, thanks to funding from UK Film\'s digital initiative, the Rio took delivery of a state of the art 2K digital projector. This enables to Rio to screen a much wider range of material, including the latest film releases being offered in digital format as well as projects made by local organisations and filmmakers, the Rio did (and does still) retain its 35mm film projectors.\nAfter a few shaky years especially when new competition arrived in the area in the shape of the Hackney Picturehouse, the Rio has emerged as independent as ever, and with an astonishingly wide range of films and events.\nThe Rio has developed into a cinema that is responsive to the interests of sections of the community often ignored by mainstream commercial cinema. \nThe programme features the best of world cinema, often eschewing big blockbusters in favour of independent titles, midweek Classic Matinées for Hackney pensioners, weekly Parent and Baby screenings, weekly film maker Q&amp;A events, stand-up comedy nights, live music, jazz and grime nights, educational screenings for over 15,000 Hackney school children a year, screenings for the hard-of-hearing, autism friendly shows and participation in a number of significant film festivals including the East End Film Fest, Fringe !, the Sex Workers Film Fest, the London Feminist Film Festival, Doc’n Roll, Scalarama, and the Kurdish Film Festival. \nLooking ahead the Rio has ambitious plans to restore the buildings somewhat scruffy exterior, bringing back some of its thirties art deco splendour, and to bring into use some of the extensive spaces that exist within the building. In late 2017 a second screen will be built in the main basement space that will allow a huge range of extra screenings, smaller festivals, community hires, educational workshops and opportunities for local film makers and film curators to present their own events. \nLooking further ahead there definitely exists enough unused space to allow for a third screen and for office space for community and third party use.\n\n','',NULL,'2017-09-25 15:08:20','2017-09-25 15:08:20',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(735,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-09-25 15:14:13','2017-09-25 15:14:13',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Img004.jpg'),(736,21,'','The account begins with John and 2 other apprentices deciding to break their indentures and leave their stocking weaver master, chiefly on account of the stocking weaver\'s wife\'s ill treatment of them:\n\n\'Her violence at length determined two other apprentices, who were nearly out of their time, to join me in taking French Leave and leaving Master and Mistress to fight it out in their own way, and eat cabbage, hasty pudding and porridge as often as they chose.  We soon had an opportunity of doing this, arising from the wedding of our Master’s brother taking place.  We had a consultation what was best to be done, and after examining the state of our exchequer, which it would be well for many others to do, before they begin any fresh prospects, and finding we had but five shillings joint stock, we determined on War, thinking that His Majesty’s service would cover if it did not relieve our poverty.  And as we were all persuaded that we were intended for General Officers at least, we walked on for some time bravely and with martial tread, having already in our own minds killed lots of Frenchmen, stormed towns and scaled fortifications.\'\n\nOne of the 3 apprentices soon turns back, however, leaving just 2 of them to continue on to Derby:\n\n\'We got into the Derby Road, reached Derby about 10 o’clock and walked into a public house bearing the sign of the Black Boy where we found a merry party consisting of an artillery sergeant with several recruits: thus we seemed thrown by fate into the very company which was to realise all our wishes\n\nWe were not long ere we convinced the sergeant we were every way qualified to enlist under his banners, and he was equally willing and ready to assure us that we were two sensible and promising lads of which his commanding officer would be proud.  This of course our vanity would not allow us to dispute.  We took the shilling and next morning were sworn to serve His Majesty King George the 3rd, got top heavy in drinking his health, or in other words, as drunk as a Lord, followed the fife and drum through the streets of Derby with the colours in our hats, delighted and thinking that we were indeed men\n\nIn the midst of my glory, I observed someone looking at me with admiration, as I then imagined, when a second glance shewed me it was my old friend the Gardener from the Hall, whose look of regret and pity was anything save that of pleasure.  He offered to pay the (smart?) money and told the sergeant as I was an apprentice he would get into a scrape if he took me.  However, the sergeant having concerted  with me, knowing we were to march early in the morning, I was already enough of a soldier to manoeuvre with the Gardener by appearing to take his advice when, like Sir Anthony Absolute, I determined to act as I liked best\n\nI felt flattered by the evident inclination on the part of the sergeant to keep me and determined to give the Gardener the go-by and let him return to his garden for hearts ease.  Though the sergeant promised to meet him at the rendezvous and deliver me up as he called it at 12 o’clock, though at the time he very well knew that we should be some miles on the way to Woolwich.  I marched early next morning accordingly and arrived in due time at Woolwich\n\nWhere I was delivered over to another sergeant, who was very really kind to me as were also many of my comrades, for almost immediately on taking up my quarters at the barracks I was ill, occasioned I believe from having taken cold sleeping in the open air.  In fact I was so fatigued and felt such an unconquerable lassitude that I almost regretted having left the stocking weaver.  A few mornings after, my loyalty and courage was completely cooled on witnessing a poor fellow flogged: for it occurred to me at the time that if I should do anything that required so severe a discipline, that though it might cure me of the fault for which the punishment was inflicted, it would ever cow my spirits as a soldier and humble me as a man\n\nIt appeared to me that existence would after this seem but a degrading necessity.  However in a few hours, I had a comfort, though it was somewhat in the nature of Job’s, however of the two it perhaps at that time was felt by me as the lesser evil.  For the examining surgeon declared me unfit for duty: owing as he asserted that there were symptoms of a rapid decline.  So much for his skill!  However, I blessed his ignorance, for death from disease had more charms for me than the cat o’ nine tails or a soldier’s life and what I had previously considered on the part of my fellow apprentice now appeared to me the better part.\n\nOn receiving my discharge and ten shillings to assist me on my way home, I considered my state indeed desperate, for, having parted with my kit on the road, thinking that I was sure the jolly sergeant and His Majesty were bound to find me other of a more conspicuous colour, but the surgeon’s fiat had gone forth, and I was not entitled to be clothed as I was not capable of duty.  Therefore, I had no choice but to philosophise, and endeavour to make the best of a bad bargain\n\nI took leave of my fellow apprentice, whose health did not prevent his seeking the “Bubble reputation in the Cannon’s Mouth”.  Miserable, lonely and in pain, I departed with the solitary ten shillings, and my dress something in the style of (Thumping Clinker’s) which is said so much to have shocked Tabitha (Bramble?)  I wandered on with the intention of returning by the road I came, but found that I had mistaken my way:  Westminster Bridge, for London.  I crossed the former, enquiring the way to Derby, but all in vain\n\nSome did not know, others laughed at my perplexity, and most seemed to deride my poverty.  Is this the beautiful world I longed to see? And promised myself that if ever I again had the certainty of porridge and cabbage, though even accompanied by the threats of a woman’s thrashing by way of desert, I would never repine.  How often the comforts of the Hall, the Footman’s kindness, the good living and privilege of speech appeared (?) before my mind’s eye, and Service, glorious Service appeared best after all\n\nFor I considered even if one Master’s circumstances changed, there were others.  And that there was none of the responsibility upon a servant, for if he did his duty, his Master was bound to pay him, and the obligation was mutual.  Thus in my own mind, I had decided that Service was indeed Independence!  And walked on resolving if possible to become again anything but a soldier!  However my resolves were assisted by a pennyworth of curds and whey on Westminster Bridge, which enabled me to reach the Park, where I sat on one of the seats, and soon forgot my cares in sleep\n\nThis was about twilight.  About ten I awoke and found myself stiff and cold.  I had just sense enough to get up and attempt to walk to endeavour to promote circulation.  I at length succeeded, and though very ill and weak, I continued to walk till morning, and never was a spring more welcome to the thirsty pilgrim than was daylight to me.  Though I feared to enquire, lest the results should be the same as on Westminster Bridge the day before, however the sight of a person in the garb of a footman was cheering.  I felt all my gratitude rush fresh to my mind: Thomas Taylor had made me feel confident in all of his cloth\n\nI asked him boldly the straight way to Derby, and he said, “Follow me, I am going that way.”  This indeed I thought an especial act of Providence.  After walking on some time, he turned and said, “Now, my lad, this is Derby Street”  “Oh,” thought I, “here’s another misery!”  But though the tears were ready to start I commanded my feelings to tell him ‘twas the Town not the Street I wanted.  I was overheard by a gentleman’s coachman who was stopping with a brake at the public house at the corner of Derby Street, who appeared to compassionate me.  He gave me something to drink which inspired with spirits to tell him all my story\n\nHe then desired me to mount the brake, and he would take me a little way on the North Road.  He did so, giving me sixpence, and commending me to God, took his leave.  Sincerely did I thank him, and sincerely did I hope that none of his own children may ever need the same kindness.  I had some coffee at an old Irishwoman, and soon after overtook a wagon, agreeing with the man to give him a shilling to take me as far as he was going my way.\'\n\nNB John eventually made his way home - mainly on foot - and after several other adventures, finally returned to the servant\'s life and ended up Valet to Lord Normanby.','',NULL,'2017-09-25 19:12:05','2017-09-29 09:15:17',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(737,18,'','','Used under Open Government Licence v1.0 (OGL).

He was then aged 35, was working as a Post Office sorter and he and his wife Catherine had been married in September 1910.\n\nAlthough he had been born in Cork he had been in England since at least the time of the 1901 census when he is found lodging with three other post office sorters, his landlord an Auxiliary postman, in the area of St Pancras.\n\n At the Wood Green tribunal he made his case for absolute exemption on the grounds that his work was of national importance but principally because of his ‘Conscientious objection to Military Service… because of my belief in the Doctrines of the Christian Faith’. He linked his Christian faith to ‘the universal brotherhood of man’ and his belief that ‘”Thou shalt not kill”’. His file includes no less than four letters written in support, all testifying to his genuine religious belief and conscientious objection to war. Amongst these is a letter from a J Sydney Cohen of St Paul’s church Wood Green who rather unhelpfully also pointed out that the given ‘the number of Catholics serving with the Colours…such objections are not held by him because he is a member of the Roman Catholic church’. It was of course a popular belief that Catholics couldn’t be pacifists. Unlike other denominations the Roman Catholic Church had no tradition of pacifism at the time of the First World War.

As he saw it the law stated that any appeal on conscientious grounds ought to be taken independently. However he argued that he had a good medical case given that ‘a specialist’ considered that his ‘weak heart’ made him unfit for General Service and that ‘the effects of a sprained ankle’ meant that he could not take up Active Service.\n\nA year later in January 1918 he is still appealing against conscription, by now his wife is pregnant and according to a letter from their doctor is also ‘suffering severely from air raid shock’\n','',NULL,'2017-09-27 06:10:35','2017-09-28 07:29:58',NULL,NULL,'file.document','JOHN O’BRIEN OR OBRIEN OR BRIEN.docx'),(746,18,'','',' By not credited - Illustration in \"The Pictorial Times\", Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1892927',NULL,'2017-09-27 14:23:51','2017-09-27 14:23:51',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','JollySailor.jpg'),(747,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-09-27 14:40:35','2017-09-27 14:40:35',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Blue Plaque for atmospheric railway.jpg'),(748,18,'','','  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England & Wales License. http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk uploaded by David Anstiss on 21 October 2011',NULL,'2017-09-27 15:21:43','2017-09-27 15:21:43',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','herons croft.jpg'),(749,21,'','Cornelius O’Driscoll arrived in England from Ireland then part of the United Kingdom some time after 1911.

He was still living in Ireland at the time of the 1911 census, with his widowed father and brother on the family farm at Ardnagroghery, County Cork. Though we also know that he in 1910 he had married his wife Bridget. We also know that he was a ‘Roman Catholic’ and that he could ‘read and write’ and spoke English and Irish. The census questions asked in Ireland were rather different to those asked in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe case he made for absolute exemption rested on three grounds, his work, his conscience and the hardship it would cause if he were to be called up. As he stated:\n\n‘I am already engaged in work of national importance in (the) Post Office. I have a conscientious objection to the taking of human life, and to assisting militarism in any way. My wife is in delicate health, and if my life should be cut short my children would be helpless. I have never harmed anyone during my life, and my wish is that I shall always be conscious of never having injured any child’s father or mother’s son’.\n\nThe tribunal claimed that he had not made a strong enough case to prove exemption on grounds of conscience and that because his family were then in Ireland they wouldn’t suffer any hardship.\n\nCornelius appealed in September 1916 this time stressing his objection to military service on grounds that he had:\n\n‘Conscientious objection to the taking of human life, and to all forms of militarism. In my youth I was taught, both by my parents and by Pastors of the Roman Catholic Church’.\n\nThis time he was successful, gaining exemption from combatant service. This he seems to have accepted though we can find out no more from the records where he was then sent. We do know, from the electoral rolls, that he carried on living at 193 Lymington Avenue until at least 1939 with his wife and younger members of his family.\n\nAs a professing Roman Catholic Cornelius O’Driscoll was unusual in gaining exemption from combatant service as it was a popular belief that Catholics couldn’t be pacifists. Unlike other denominations the Roman Catholic Church had no tradition of pacifism at the time of the First World War.

He was the youngest of the 8 children of a builder’s foreman and his wife and was born in Fulham. In 1916 he was 39, married with three children so almost out of age for conscription. He gave his occupation as printer, ‘own business’, with an address in Commerce Road, Bounds Green. He’d been running his own printing firm since 1906 and it was the future of his firm, together with his conscientious objection and his precarious health which led him to apply for absolute exemption. He had a doctor’s certificate to show that he had been left with chronic bronchitis following pleurisy and pneumonia and he wrote to say that if he were to be called up his business would close leaving him with financial ruin.\n\nHowever he was also clear that combat was ‘contrary to the teachings of the New Testament’ and with his application he enclosed a letter from a minister at his church saying that he had been Church Secretary and that he ‘carried his objection to war to the point of not allowing his children to play with toy soldiers’.\n\nThe Wood Green Tribunal heard his case and gave Stanley temporary exemption for 3 months on condition that he join the Volunteer Force, if the work was too heavy he should be given clerical or light work. But there was a snag. He was to take part in 12 drills a month with the Wood Green Battalion of the Middlesex Volunteer Reserve. He made it clear that he was not prepared to take part in anything military, His brother, an architect and surveyor in Shepherds Bush had also written to the Tribunal, emphasising Stanley’s poor health and the sincerity of his convictions, though he stressed that he did not share his views. He himself was a member of the Hammersmith Military Tribunal.\n\nStanley was not prepared to take part and so the Tribunal withdrew his certificate of exemption, telling him to register with an Employment Exchange to find Work of National Importance within four weeks. By the end of January he had a job, working on the farm and market garden of Messrs Man &amp; Sons in Twickenham as an ‘ordinary hand’. He had made his stand but at the cost of having to travel across London to work in quite different conditions from those he was used to.\n\nWe don’t know how the war ended for Stanley Cracknell but we do find him back at his printing firm in 1926 according to Kelly’s Directory.

The neighborhood of Norwood and Shooter’s-hill appear, with this class of society, to have been privileged places; where unmolested they presumed to abide, with no laws to regulate their conduct, but such as they made for themselves, or approved of. Until within these few years Norwood was their court and headquarters; and here they assembled from all parts, to render obeisance and homage to their reigning sovereign. Like the Egyptians of old, they are not governed by the law Salique, and still continue faithfully to observe the mandates of their modern Cleopatras. The most remarkable was Margaret Finch, born at Sutton, in Kent; who, after traversing the whole of England, in the double capacity of gipsy and thief, finally fixed her place of residence at Norwood. About eleven years prior to her decease, she adopted a habit, and afterwards a constant custom, of sitting on the ground with her chin resting on her knees, which caused her sinews to become so contracted, that she could not extend herself or change her position; so that when she died it was necessary to force her body into a box, made sizeable to her usual posture: she was thus conveyed in a hearse, accompanied by two coaches, to Beckingham, in Kent, and there decently interred, in the year 1740, a funeral sermon being preached on the occasion; the expense of which was defrayed by the neighboring publicans about Norwood and Beckingham. The singularity of her figure, and the fame of her fortune-telling, drew vast concourse of persons from the highest rank and quality to that of the lowest class in life. Norwood, and the roads leading to it, on a fine Sunday, resembled the scene of a fair; and, with the greatest difficulty only, could a seat or a mug of beer be obtained, at the place generally called the Gipsy-house. This trade was of too profitable a description easily to be given up; and a new queen was speedily introduced, no way behind her predecessor in fraud and cunning. Again did the fortune-telling and thieving profession proceed successfully hand in hand; the publicans encouraged the callings of both, from the grist it brought to their own mills; and the neighbours [sic] were fearful of making complaints, in dread of the consequence. About thirty years since, the gipsy tribe visibly decreased near Norwood; and, since the murder of Matthews, the Dulwich hermit, it is a rarity to meet with a single straggler of that description.

It appears that besides being occasionally brought before the magistrates for robberies of chickens and other denizens of the farm-yard, the gipsies here were occasionally made by the justices to feel the full force of the laws against vagrancy, and that occasionally they were \"hunted down\" without having done much to deserve it, being made the scapegoats of others who had fairer skins. Hither the Londoners of the last century resorted in fine weather to have their future lot in life foretold to them by the palmistry of the \"Zingari\" folk.\nGipsy Hill, and an inn still called the \"Queen of the Gipsies,\" commemorate the inmate of a small outhouse who lived on this hill, and who died here in 1760—it is said at the age of 109 years.

She was buried in a deep square box, as, from her constant habit of sitting with her chin resting on her knees, her muscles had become so contracted that at last she could not alter her position. \"This woman,\" observes Mr. Larwood, in his \"History of Signboards,\" \"when a girl of seventeen, may have been one of the dusky gang that pretty Mrs. Samuel Pepys and her companions went to consult in August, 1668, as her lord records in his \'Diary\' the same evening, the 11th: \'This afternoon my wife, and Mercer, and Deb went with Pelling to see the gypsies at Lambeth and have their fortunes told; but what they did I did not enquire.\'\" \"A granddaughter of Margaret Finch,\" Mr. Larwood adds, \"was living in a cottage close by in the year 1800.\"\nNorwood must really have derived its name from being the \"wood\" that lay to the \"north\" of the large ecclesiastical town of Croydon; for it lies to the south of London. Two centuries ago Norwood was really a wood and nothing more. Aubrey, giving an account of Croydon at that period, in his \"Perambulation of Surrey,\" writes: \"In this parish lies the great wood, called Norwood, belonging to the see of Canterbury, wherein was an ancient remarkable tree, called Vicar\'s Oak, where four parishes meet in a point.\" These parishes, doubtless, were Lambeth, Camberwell, Lewisham, and Croydon.\"\n','http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol6/pp303-319',NULL,'2017-10-07 10:26:09','2017-10-07 10:27:51',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(781,18,'','','eBay website',NULL,'2017-10-07 10:50:01','2017-10-07 10:50:01',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Margaret Finch\'s cottage.JPG'),(782,18,'','','By Wheeltapper (Own work) [CC0], via Wikimedia Commons',NULL,'2017-10-07 14:30:29','2017-10-07 14:30:29',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Lych_gate,_St_George\'s_church_Beckenham (2).jpg'),(783,18,'','','beckenhamhistory.co.uk  website',NULL,'2017-10-07 15:04:01','2017-10-07 15:04:01',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','mfinch-large.jpg'),(784,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-10-09 16:49:32','2017-10-09 16:49:32',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Gasworks near battersea station.jpg'),(785,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-10-09 16:55:52','2017-10-09 16:55:52',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','church tower.jpeg'),(786,21,'','The wood is  of considerable historical and environmental significance. Tree and plant species suggest it is ancient woodland and research has proved that it has been unchanged for some 800 years.

This would make sense as it is on the summit of the highest hill in the neighbourhood and so provides a good defensive position. The ponds are now considered to have been fire pits rather than grain stores.. Traces of a Roman camp have also been found in the vicinity (in the garden of a house in what is now Romanhurst Avenue).\n\nI was also told as a child that this hill had been a ‘Beacon Hill’ on which a beacon would be lit to signal danger – as for instance when the Spanish Armada was threatening to invade in 1588.

It was a calamity of lightning speed and indescribable confusion, in which over 700 carefree day trippers, most of them women and children, were plunged without warning to their doom in a fleeting time span of fewer than five minutes.\nThe Princess Alice, one of the most popular of all the early excursion pleasure craft on the Thames, was shattered like an egg-shell and cut completely in half by the knife-edge bows of a sea-going outward bound collier (coal transport). In a split second the 900 passengers were at the mercy of the river. Heart-rending scenes were witnessed in the gloaming of an autumn evening.\n\nHistory of That Fateful Pleasure Cruise\nTuesday, September 3rd, 1878, was a perfect day for a river cruise and a holiday adventure. In the sun’s warm and friendly glow the Thames ran like a carnival ribbon through London and outwards towards the sea and the Thames Estuary..... The Princess Alice was a vessel of only 158 tons. She was only 220 feet long, with a beam of 20 feet. A toy of a paddle-steamer, yet to those at London Bridge that day, she was a dream ship. They looked with fascination upon the few flags that dressed her rigging, the tall, murky funnel, the sailors who crossed the decks.\nOver 10 years old and in the service of the London Steamboat Company, the Princess Alice had originally been licensed to carry fewer than 500 passengers; but now, for the smooth-water service on the River Thames, she had a Board of Trade certificate enabling her to carry as many as 936. The ghastly events of this day were to prove that both in construction and capacity the ship was totally unsuited for so heavy and intensive a human cargo.\nThe River Thames Excursion Begins\nA cheer rose as the rail-gates were opened. The multitude of trippers streamed aboard, jumping, swinging, clattering on the gang-plank. Nine hundred people boarded the vessel. The Princess Alice sank lower in the water under the burden of the happy day trippers. The trippers were packed in like merchandise destined for stormy seas. Every inch of space was strained. Few could move about. Parents took their children on their knees. Men squatted on the bulwarks, squeezed themselves into strange corners, lounged on the companionways.\nCaptain Grinstead, a man with over 20 years experience of the Thames, was active on the bridge with the first mate, Mr.Long. With tight little blasts on her shrill whistle, a round of cheering and applause from the pier, the thrash of the paddles, the Princess Alice got under way. It was 11am.\nNone sensed disaster, not even danger. Why would they? With the perfect sky above, the river as smooth as glass, land and the security that offered available on either side, and with the knowledge that home and friends were only a few miles distant, who would have predicted that, before the day was done, this happy ship’s company, on London’;s own Thames, was to encounter peril more sudden, more terrifying, more devastating than any deep-sea wreck might know?\nDownstream River Thames\nDownstream she sailed, the day-trippers cheering each popular landmark they passed. Bread was thrown to the gulls that darted, dipped and dived in the wake of the steamer. Cockney repartee was exchanged with fluent and friendly bargees. Sailors on the towering decks of steamers waved and called their cheerful greetings. Cheeky, puffing tugs whistled a welcome. The Princess Alice had the freedom of the river that fateful day.\nThis happy day, its events and joys, its discoveries and adventures, speeded by. In the early evening, as the Princess Alice was homeward bound from Sheerness in Kent, the 900 people aboard were tired but content. It had been a lovely escape from the noise and smell of 19th century London. The merriment lingered on and the Princess Alice steamed homeward bound.\nEven the sleepy children could still find in the operations of the officers and crew, in the funnel, engines, ropes and windlasses, and in the passing pageant of the river, an endless source of fascination. There was no room to dance, save in an occasional huddled group, but voices rose in song to the accompaniment of concertina and flute, and the ship’s band.\nSweethearts linked hands as they leaned over the rails, seeing beyond the river into strange realms of romance. It is on record that there were several newly married couples on board, and for none can there have ever been any more tragic a honeymoon. Below decks in the big forward and aft saloons, the crowds were dense, surging even along the alleyways.\nCalling at Gravesend Kent\nAt 6pm the Princess Alice called at Gravesend in Kent, and then began the last, fateful, unforgettable twenty-mile run back towards the London Bridge that hundreds aboard her were never to see again. Those on the shore at Gravesend who waved her farewell, saw her steer for London, her paddles thumping fitfully, very low in the water, did not dream that her cheerful parting whistle was indeed a tragic salute, that they were gazing on a ship of doom.\nBetween Gravesend and London Bridge, as every student of the river knows, the Thames winds tortuously, and the biggest bend of all is called Gallion’s Reach. The very name has a ring that is sinister. Gallion’s Reach, a name that was destined to be on the lips of millions – the sound of it to chill their hearts cold.\nAt Gallion’s Reach the navigator knows the need for caution. At least one serious collision had occurred here before the disaster to the Princess Alice. On this occasion the tide was running at the ebb, and to defeat its force the Princess Alice, whenever possible, hugged the bank of the Thames. She was in midstream, however, half-way down the Reach, off the City of London Gasworks at Beckton, and in sight of North Woolwich Pier, when catastrophe dealt the death-blow.\n \nNorth Woolwich Pier\nThe Princess Alice Fateful Collision\nIt was about 8pm. The night had closed in. The moon was up.  There was a stillness and magic in the air.\nStraight for the Princess Alice came the Bywell Castle, a collier of some 890 tons bound for the Tyne in the North of England, a “great black phantom,” as she was afterwards described. Without her cargo of coal, she stood high in the water, and to those aboard the little excursions steamer she seemed indeed a mammoth of the deep. Nearer she came, nearer still, until her great iron walls appeared to loom like a cliff overhead.\nAt first the day-trippers were blind to the danger. Strange and unaccustomed to the ways of ships and the river, they saw no menace in the close proximity of the Bywell Castle. With simple trust and honest faith, they knew no fear. Some even waved to shadowy forms high up on the Bywell Castle, for they could not see the faces of these men, nor the horror and apprehension written upon them.\nThe ship’s band played on. The singing continued. An all too familiar occurrence in tragic British maritime disasters.\nPanic, Mayhem, Tragedy on The Thames\nThen came the inevitable. For a second, like a great angry avenger, the Bywell Castle hovered over the starboard bow of the Princess Alice. With a dull, ripping crash of awful havoc, relentless and certain, the sharp edge of the great steel bow cut right into the vitals of the doomed pleasure steamer. The fatal blow was struck.\nThe Princess Alice, split and smashed, shook and quivered under the brutality of that fearful impact. But there was only one tremor. It was a death blow, ruthless, complete. The starboard paddle-box was splintered to fragments. The knife-edge bow of the Bywell Castle had driven right through to the engine-room. For all that mattered, the Princess Alice was sliced in two. Water gushed in, filling every void in its path. The forward part of the vessel sank like a bag of nails. Lifting slowly, almost to the perpendicular, the aft part stood for a few moments in the fashion of a huge, fantastic gravestone, and then was gone.\"\n','http://www.eastlondonhistory.co.uk and London Historians blog @https://londonhistorians.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/over-600-perish-in-woolwich-pleasure-boat-disaster/',NULL,'2017-10-23 14:58:01','2017-10-24 15:08:15',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(802,18,'','','http://jot101.com/2015/11/the-princess-alice-paddle-steamer/',NULL,'2017-10-23 15:08:02','2017-10-24 08:18:02',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','Princess-Alice-bodies-rescue-pic-106.jpg'),(803,18,'','','Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6615686',NULL,'2017-10-23 15:15:59','2017-10-23 15:15:59',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','1024px-Princess_alice_collision_in_thames.jpg'),(804,18,'','','',NULL,'2017-10-23 15:24:04','2017-10-23 15:24:04',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','princess alice map.jpg'),(805,21,'','Commencement of seagoing career 1922\nDec 27 - Joined S.S.

The family had moved to Queens Road, New Southgate by 1911 where six of them were living in three rooms. By the time he came before the Wood Green Tribunal, George was 21 and working as an assistant manager and roundsman for a wine and spirit merchant, he was then living at 2 Herbert Road, Bowes Park. His father had died three years earlier.\n\nHe applied for absolute exemption on three grounds: hardship as two of his brothers were already in the army and he was now the main supporter of his mother and at work his manager was new and needed his support; health as he was ‘consumptive’; third, that he had ‘strong conscientious objection to undertaking combative service.’\n\nAt first the Wood Green Tribunal seem to have been sympathetic, giving him temporary exemption because of his ‘domestic position’. Unfortunately for him, the military representative appealed  on the grounds that since he only allowed his mother 8 shillings a week no hardship would ensue from his being called up.\n\nGeorge appealed against this but was turned down, his certificate of temporary exemption was withdrawn. He then tried to appeal to the Central Tribunal saying he wasn’t satisfied with the Appeal Tribunal’s decision. He hadn’t had a fair hearing. The only question he had been asked was about the amount he gave his mother and they had taken no notice of the fact that she was then seriously ill. He pointed out that in addition to the 8 shillings he also gave her support in kind, groceries etc. Exemption on grounds of conscience does not seem to have been a part of his case by this stage. He was refused leave to appeal.\n\nWe know nothing more about what happened to George Dimmock after May 1916 when his case seems to have been closed.

This makes him a Haringey conscientious objector, though as we’ll see he didn’t spend long living in the area.\n\nHe made his case on the grounds that ‘it is wrong for me to engage in work for or with an organisation which main object is dealing destruction to other peoples and nations, neither in defence or offence’. He based his belief in ‘the teaching of Christ as regards loving all sorts of men and overcoming evil with good’. But he also rejected the idea of being part of something from which he wouldn’t be able to resign when he thought orders were wrong. He supported his case with three letters, one from his father, a JP in Dublin who wrote that he had tried to dissuade his son but also pointed out that he had been to Germany on a friendship basis and had joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation and that his son is ‘sincere in his beliefs’. Another letter came from a Peterborough address and referred to ‘heated discussions’ on disarmament. The third came from Elias Williams who had been minister at the Presbyterian  Church in Southgate Road when Alec was treasurer. He emphasised that Alec’s opinions were ‘the outcome of deep and long-lasting convictions’ and were not ‘hastily assumed’.\n\nHe was granted exemption, on condition that he found work of national importance, in a munitions factory or controlled establishment. However, the Pelham committee which decided on such matters had been informed that because of his work, the General Post Office, where he was assistant to the chief engineer, wanted to keep him in his job. It seems that this was going to be good enough, for the next time anything happens, it is June 1918. He has married Ellen Maria Gronwall, from Sweden and they are the parents of their first daughter, Ingrid, and are living at 8 Aden Terrace, Stoke Newington. The military representative had asked for a review of his certificate of exemption which Wood Green tribunal had then withdrawn. He appealed, pointing out that his views were unchanged and he was still doing ‘good work’ at the Post Office though he was wiling to do other work of national importance. In the end it was agreed that he would take on twenty hours a week voluntary work, as well as his job at the Post Office. In October 1918 he wrote to say that he had joined the St John Ambulance and would be doing ‘hospital work’.\n\nAlec Eason was born in 1887 and came from Dublin originally where he had been a grammar school boy. He won a place at the prestigious Mill Hill School then went on to Cambridge where in 1910 he won a prize for a report on the explosion temperature of coal gas, graduating with First Class honours in Mechanical Science. He began a career in research which took him to the Post Office where he remained for the rest of his working life. After graduating from university however, he joined Robert Browning Hall, ‘Browning Hall’, in Walworth. This was one of the settlements, organised usually by universities in deprived areas to work with local people. Browning Hall was rather different from the other university settlements because it was led by Herbert Stead and his wife, leading radicals who campaigned successfully for the pension and good quality housing locally. At Browning Hall there were adult education classes, a temperance tavern and savings clubs. In 1911 at the time of the census, Alec is listed there as a ‘boarder’ presumably living the frugal life of the workers at Browning Hall and joining in with campaigning.\n\nAfter the war  and by 1919, Alec and Ellen had two daughters, Ingrid and Mildred,  and Alec had also written a book, Flow and Measurement of Air and gases. This was later to be translated into several languages and was followed by two other books in 1923 and 1925 as well as technical papers on telegraphy and telephony.\n\nWhether or not he continued with his anti-war convictions we don’t know. He and Ellen moved to Southgate in 1923, then to Surrey in1937 and finally to Harrow after World War Two. He died in 1968 aged 81 and Ellen died in 1977 when she would have been almost a hundred years old.\n\nIWM/PR','',NULL,'2017-12-24 08:18:22','2017-12-24 08:18:22',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(838,21,'','Russell Everett was working as a clerk in the Customs &amp; Excise, living at 129, Crescent Road, Alexandra Park,  when he made his application for absolute exemption at the Wood Green Tribunal in February 2016. He was the third oldest child of the 6 children of a retired inspector in the Metropolitan Police. His father, Benjamin, was 55 and was running a grocer’s shop, assisted by Russell’s mother. In 1911 he also described himself as a ‘pensioned inspector’.\n\nRussell made his case on the grounds that war was against the ‘spirit, life and teaching of Jesus Christ. As a Christian he could not take part. Being a Socialist and believing In the ‘oneness of humanity’ and ‘human brotherhood’ also meant that he could not become involved, ‘only understanding &amp; goodwill can destroy wars’.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed his claim for absolute exemption on the grounds that his statement of conscience was political and he was given non-combatant status. In May Russell makes an appeal against non-combatant service because this would still mean participation in the war. He also argued that the Tribunal made no attempt to find out anything about him lumping his case with others and that the hearing was ‘quite negligible’.\n\nHis appeal was dismissed and he was not allowed to appeal further to the Central Tribunal.\n\nOn 6th June he was sent to enlist in the 4th Eastern Company of the Non-Combatant Corps at Mill Hill where he was certified B1 for fitness with the possibility of being sent abroad. This is not the end of his story, however. Like many other men he seems to have refused to comply with the military discipline of non-combatant enlistment and he was court martialled at Seaford only a few days later, serving 84 days hard labour at Maidstone prison. In August 1916 he was transferred to the notorious Dyce Camp in Aberdeen, a work centre organised by the Brace Committee. He rejected his allocation and was returned to his unit for further court martials. By January 1919 he had served two other prison sentences, in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin and in Liverpool Prison and was finally released on medical grounds.\n\nAfter the war we know very little about him. He married in 1921 and seems to have lived in Enfield during the 1920s, dying in Amersham in 1970 at the age of 82.\n','',NULL,'2017-12-24 08:49:57','2017-12-24 08:49:57',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(839,21,'','Edmund Ford was born in Gloucestershire where his father was a wool cloth worker according to the 1891 census. Ten years later, by the time Edmund was 18, Edmund was living with his widowed mother and five sisters, working as an ‘outfitter’s assistant’. By 1911 Edmund had moved to London, was working as salesman at a gents’ outfitter in the City, and recently married to Nellie. They were living in Fulham but his address is 128 Russell Avenue when he came before the Wood Green Tribunal in September 1916.\n\nEdmund is very clear in his handwritten statement to the Tribunal making the case for absolute exemption, that he has ‘for years’ been opposed to capital punishment and that in the case of the present war, if ‘the quarrel makers had themselves to do the fighting, another way of settlement would have been discovered’. He goes on to ‘honour’ any man who lays down their own life for a cause he believes in, but that ‘taking the life of a fellow creature’ is a different matter. He states that he has been a socialist for 10 years and that he believes in the brotherhood of man and that ‘War is the enemy of all progress’.\n\nThe Wood Green Tribunal dismissed his statement of conscience. They found that his objection to military service ‘appears to be based on political grounds’, that he was not a member of a religious organisation which is opposed to war and that in addition he was not prepared to do work of national importance.\n\nEdmund’s clearly anti-military statement was no doubt helped by his position as branch secretary of the Tottenham No-Conscription Fellowship. He would have known how others were faring at Tribunals, in fact he points out that the Central Tribunal had acknowledged the genuine views of several COs whose cases had been turned down by the Wood Green Tribunal. He would have been in touch with other COs and also would be only too aware of the likely outcome of his resistance to any form of participation in military activities.\n\nHe was still appealing against Tribunal decisions in 1917 but after June he is court martialled at Mill Hill. This happens three times, and he spends time in Wormwood Scrubs and Wandsworth Prisons, eventually being released from Wandsworth in April 1919 following a government rule which allowed men held under the Army Act, including conscientious objectors, to be released if they had served two years. He was one of the COs who paid a hard price for his beliefs. We know this from harrowing accounts of prison life which other COs wrote at the time.\n\nFrom the electoral rolls it seems he was living in Hampstead with his wife, Nellie between 1921 and 1929 and in Hendon from 1931 to 1939.

DPB was, like many nineteenth-century public baths, created as a result of community-based campaigns to convince local authorities that the construction of bath- and wash-houses were essential to health and cleanliness of the general public. Designed by Spalding &amp; Cross, due to delays caused by the revising of drainage plans and a dispute over the quality of lime being used in the concrete, the baths’ official opening was postponed to 1892. They were an immediate success: on 16 July 1892, The South London Press, a local newspaper reported that “during the week ended July 9, 4,291 bathers visited the baths where the warm private baths are now open. The first-class bath is now filled from the 30-inch main, and the water is all that can be desired—quite clear and clean.”\nThe Baths were temporarily repurposed during both world wars. In the First World War they were used by local hospitals and the Red Cross; additionally, the Baths housed refugees and troops, and were occasionally used as an unofficial shelter during numerous air raids. In preparation for World War II, the baths were closed for public access and repurposed in 1938–39. These WWII preparations included the boarding over of both swimming pools for medical supplies and first aid treatment. During a fuel shortage in 1939, the pools were closed for the winter. In 1940 the pools were again planned to close for the winter, but were kept open and full for use by the Auxiliary Fire Service, for use when dealing with fire from air raid damage. \nNow known as Dulwich Leisure Centre, in May 2009 a multi-million-pound refurbishment process began at the Baths, which was completed by June 2011. Dulwich leisure Centre contains all the amenities that one would expect from a high-grade, modern public leisure center, such as a gym, café, dance studio, children’s classes, exercise classes, treatment rooms, and, of course, a swimming pool. \n\n \n~ 9/11/2017, Dulwich Public Baths\n\n\n\nBibliography:\n•	Bird, Polly. \"The Origins of Victorian Public Baths, with special reference to Dulwich Baths.\" The Local Historian Baths and Wash Houses Historical Archive.

We know something of his early life from the census returns and we have some sketchy information about what happened to him during World War One. It seems he objected to military service as he was exempted from combatant service at Paddington Town Hall and allocated to the 3rd Eastern Non Combatant Corps in June 1916. He was eventually demobbed at Aldershot in December 1919. We don’t know what the details of his case were as his military service tribunal records aren’t available to us.\n\nArthur was the second youngest of the five sons of John and Sarah Godwin. He was born in Enfield in 1890, when the family was living at 1 Chase Side. His father was then a commercial traveller in machine belting. By 1901 the family had moved south of the river to Bexhill and his father had become a cycle maker and two of his brothers were apprenticed in the cycle trade. By then Arthur was 10. We’ve not managed to find him in the 1911 census but what makes him eligible to be mentioned in the Haringey records is that he was living at 31 Mark Road, Wood Green. He gives his occupation as tailor’s cutter. In August 1917 he married Theodora Watkins at Croydon.\n\nTheodora’s address is given as being in South Norwood, however his demob address is in Farnborough. It’s possible she moved to be near him and that the two of them stayed in that area for a while as the births of their two children, Leonard and Theodora, were registered in nearby Hartley Wintney in 1919 and 1924 respectively. We know no more about Arthur apart from the date of his death registered in Chatham at the age of 68, in July 1958. Theodora died four years later.\n','',NULL,'2018-01-09 15:59:42','2018-01-09 15:59:42',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(854,21,'','William  or ‘Will’ Good is one of the few COs in Haringey whose photograph we have.

The family were living at 11 Canning Crescent, Wood Green when William junior came before the Wood Green Tribunal in February 1916.\n\nTheir father, according to the 1901 census, had been a maker of boot polishes. By 1911 he was retired, though according to William junior’s niece by marriage, Eileen Bostle, who has helped us with our research into the Good family* he was making sausages somewhere near to home. She knows this because her father delivered sausages to local customers on his bicycle. William junior was by this time a commercial traveller in cloth.\n\nThe Good family were members of the Exclusive Plymouth Brethren. Exclusive Brethren have always lived within closely prescribed rules which they believe are set out in the bible. Amongst these is a rule against bearing arms.

His duties would most likely have been building  roads, carrying out timber work, quarrying, sanitary duties and handling supplies. Their work would not have been light as they were supposed to endure ‘equal sacrifice’.\n\nAfter the war, in 1921, Will married Kathleen Ada Perolz and some time later, according to Eileen Bostle, they moved to Watford and then to St Albans where Will became manager of a Singer sewing machine shop. Their only child, Irene, was born in 1923. They lived tin St Albans for the rest of their lives. Eileen remembers her uncle:\n\n‘Will was very ingenious, and converted a sewing machine into a projector to show glass lantern slides.

His mother, Marianna eventually had four children. Charles was the eldest, followed by Mabelle, Kathleen and Theodore. The family were Quakers or at least had Quaker sympathies as Charles junior was sent off to board at the Society of Friends School in Colchester.\n\nHe worked on his own account as a market gardener after leaving school; in fact none of his siblings joined their father on the farm. Mabelle stayed at home, as did Kathleen who was an invalid, while Theodore left to become a miller’s traveller, at Braintree.\n\nBy 1911 we find Charles Cuthbert lodging with the Barringer family at 206 High Road, Wood Green. Edward George Barringer was a clerk, two years older than Charles. He and his wife Clara had three children aged between 12 and 4. Charles was working as a seedsman and corn dealer, so he was still connected with the land, even though living in urban north London.\n\nIt looks as if Charles didn’t come before any military tribunal because the Quaker records show that he was working for the Friends’ War Victims Relief Service (FWVRS) and was in France from August 1915. There he would have been working on reconstruction with people who had lost their homes and livelihoods as a result of the war. He might well have been putting his farming knowledge and experience into practice as some members of the FWVRS helped to save and bring in harvests. He might also have been amongst members who helped to build pre-fabricated houses to replace homes and communities destroyed in battles.\n\nWe don’t know a lot about what happened to Charles after the war. Edward Barringer seems to have joined the Non-Combatant Corps as by the end of the war he was entitled to a British War and Victory medal. Perhaps the Barringers shared Charles pacifist convictions.

Charles and Clara had married the year before and in 1929 they sail to Fremantle, Western Australia with their 11 year old daughter on the Hobson’s Bay.

Earlier records show him boarding at Carlisle, working as a travelling sorter on the railways. He was brought up by his widowed mother with two older brothers, his father having died before Alfred was a year old.\n\nLike others working for the GPO, Alfred’s case came up a year after the Tribunal system was set up, often this was because the Post Office was reluctant to let men go and applied for exemption. In making his case he mentions that he had been temporarily reserved and so his appeal had been deferred. He made a claim for absolute exemption from military service as a Christian. Quoting passages from the New Testament he argues that it is against his conscience to take up arms and as ‘God in his goodness has allowed the Conscience clause to appear in the Conscription Act’ he felt he had a good basis for his claim. In support he produced five letters from men who all supported him, pointing out that they had known him to be a Christian for some years before the outbreak of war and whose conscience would not allow him to fight. Two mentioned his membership of the Plymouth Brethren and his attendance at their meetings in Wellesley Hall, West Green Road.\n\nThe local tribunal had found themselves unable on the basis of his personal statement to grant him absolute exemption on grounds of conscience when they met in February 2017, but after he had submitted his letters of support the appeal tribunal over-ruled their decision and he was granted exemption from combatant service in April 2017, his conscientious objection having been accepted by the military representative, Captain Bax. Like almost all the COs who accepted exemption from combatant service, we know nothing about what happened, to Alfred, where he was sent or whether he was drawn into situations where he was close to the fighting or felt that his principles were being compromised.\n\nAfter the war, Alfred and Evelyn and their daughter, Evelyn, moved to 69 Victoria Road and stayed there until they moved to Enfield in 1936. Alfred’s death is recorded in 1944, in Enfield.

We can’t see anyone of his name who seems to match the few details we have, in the census and electoral rolls that we’ve looked at online. What we do know is that in February 1916 when he makes his case for absolute exemption he is working at the National Union of Railwaymen’s offices at Unity House, Euston Road. He gives his job as clerk, working on national health insurance. He would have been a part of that side of the union’s work as an Approved Society under Lloyd George’s National Insurance Act of 1911. This Act was the first move in what later became the welfare state and a system of universal benefits available to all.\n\nWe don’t know if Frederick belonged to any particular group. He makes a personal statement in February 1916 when he comes before the Wood Green Tribunal. On his form he writes that he considers war to be ‘a crime against humanity’. His duty is ‘to follow the dictates of my conscience…as a Briton, and a true lover of freedom, I will do it be the consequences what they may to me personally’. The Tribunal rejects his case on the grounds that he had not shown that he was a member of a religious group which was opposed to military service. He was denied absolute exemption but it seems likely that he didn’t contest the non-combatant status he was given, though his attempt to appeal against this was turned down by the military representative.\n\nAfter that decision in April 2016 we hear no more of him as the records of the Non Combatant Corps either no longer exist or are not available for searching.

In the 1911 census he was living at this address, with his father, mother and three brothers. All four sons were working in various kinds of office jobs. Their father was an upholsterer. He married Alice Maud Annie Denning in 1914.\n\nIn his application for exemption Sidney gives his occupation as ‘Accountant, having sole charge of the accounting business of the Stratford Branch of the Royal Insurance Co Ltd.’ He makes his claim on the grounds that he did not want to take part in ‘any work that has for its direct object the destruction of human life’. The Wood Green tribunal did not think that he was a ‘genuine conscientious objector’ this was despite the fact that he had sent in four letters of support from addresses in Lady Margaret Road, Gladstone Avenue, Morley Avenue and the Peabody Estate. These made it clear that he was an active Christian, a preacher, a member of the assembly meeting in Lordship Hall and because of his beliefs a conscientious objector. The Brethren, or Plymouth Brethren as they are also known, seem to have been well organised with letters of support for members showing their activity and commitment.\n\nSidney appealed in June 1916 pointing out that he had been a member of the ‘”brethren”’ a religious body opposed to war since October 1912 and had been publicly baptised at Lordship Hall in 1913. He also pointed out that he had been classified C.1 and would ‘gladly undertake any work say in a hospital as accountant etc’.\n\nHis appeal was successful and in April 2017 he was notified that he was exempted from combatant service and that his conscientious objection had been recognised. For some reason his case had been long drawn out, possibly because he had an army medical in November 1916 when it was judged that his ‘Physique was not good enough for A or B’ but is recorded as being allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps Eastern Division. He was to have a second medical in Whitehall in May 1918 when he was passed B (1). We don’t know why he had this second medical but he was finally demobbed from the 6 Eastern Division of the Non-Combatant Corps in February 1919.\n\nThe electoral rolls show Sidney still living at 75 Mark Road with Alice Maud, until 1927 when they move to 247 Gladstone Avenue. By 1931 they are living in Higham Road, Tottenham with their, presumably, two children. Alice died in 1949 and Sidney remarried the next year. The death of ‘Reverend’ Jarrett is recorded at Hatfield in 1961.\n\nPR/IWM','',NULL,'2018-01-29 08:14:41','2018-01-29 08:14:41',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(877,18,'','','British History Online',NULL,'2018-01-30 13:31:09','2018-01-30 13:35:23',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','WhittingtonsHouse.JPG'),(878,21,'','Catherine \"Kate\" Eddowes (14 April 1842 – 30 September 1888) was one of the victims in the Whitechapel murders. She was the second person killed in the early hours of Sunday 30 September 1888, a night which already had seen the murder of Elizabeth Stride less than an hour earlier. These two murders are commonly referred to as the \"double event\" and have been attributed to the mysterious serial killer known as Jack the Ripper.\n\nAt 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September, Eddowes was found lying drunk in the road on Aldgate High Street by PC Louis Robinson. She was taken into custody and then to Bishopsgate police station, where she was detained, giving the name \"Nothing\", until she was sober enough to leave at 1 a.m. on the morning of 30 September.  On her release, she gave her name and address as \"Mary Ann Kelly of 6 Fashion Street\".\n\nWhen leaving the station, instead of turning right to take the shortest route to her home in Flower and Dean Street, she turned left towards Aldgate.\n\nAt 1:45 a.m., Eddowes\' mutilated body was found in the south-west corner of Mitre Square by the square\'s beat policeman PC Edward Watkins.[18] Watkins said that he entered the square at 1:44 a.m, having previously been there at 1:30 a.m. He called for assistance at a tea warehouse in the square, where night watchman George James Morris, who was an ex-policeman, had noticed nothing unusual.\n\nThough the murder occurred within the City of London, it was close to the boundary of Whitechapel where the previous Whitechapel murders had occurred. The mutilation of Eddowes\' body and the abstraction of her left kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of Jack the Ripper and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim Annie Chapman.\n\nOn 1 October, a postcard, dubbed the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard and signed \"Jack the Ripper\", was received by the Central News Agency. It claimed responsibility for Stride\'s and Eddowes\' murders, and described the killing of the two women as the \"double event\", a designation which has endured.  It has been argued that the postcard was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.   Police officials later claimed to have identified a journalist as the author of the postcard, and dismissed it as a hoax, an assessment shared by most Ripper historians.   \n\nSOURCE:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Eddowes\n','Wikipedia',NULL,'2018-01-31 13:18:59','2018-01-31 13:18:59',NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(879,18,'','','Pubhistory.com; Collage image collection',NULL,'2018-02-05 13:01:29','2018-02-05 13:01:29',NULL,NULL,'file.jpeg','ThreeNunsHotel.JPG'),(880,20,'','','University of California Santa Barbara English Broadside Ballad Archive.

The pair were fortunate enough to meet another market trader at Spitalfields, a Mr Percy Dalton, who had access to fresh fruit and nuts—Mr Dalton was known around the market as the ‘Peanut King’ due to, of course, the surfeit of peanuts he traded daily.

Instead, he arrived in Bristol in 1904, aged twenty-two, with a focus on advancing his education. ... A year after qualifying, Dr Moody\'s practice opened at 111 King\'s Road in Peckham, south-east London. Although he\'d faced overt acts of racist discrimination, it was his Christianity rather than his politics that drew Dr Moody to his activism. For him, racism was a religious issue. He was active in the wider Christian community. His respectable, middle-class job positioned him as a beacon for black people in 1920s and 1930s Britain. He advocated on their behalf, quickly becoming known as a man who would help if you were in need. That popularity and momentum led Dr Harold Moody to form the League of Coloured Peoples in 1931\' (Eddo-Lodge, R. 2017. \"Why I\'m no longer talking to white people about race\". London, New York: Bloomsbury Circus., pp. 15-17).  •  The video on Dr Moody is by the Black History Walks: African History in the city of London collective (http://www.blackhistorywalks.co.uk/index.php), and Standard YouTube License applies.

At a time when the skyline of this part of London was regularly described as being ‘a forest of masts’ there could be few places offering better opportunities for a caulker. The caulker’s job was skilled and essential.  Wooden ships were infinitely repairable, and I have read accounts where it was said that after repairs, the ships were sometimes even better than before.  The skills of carpenters, sail makers, rope makers and caulkers would be relied on, and they would have to make repairs in difficult and dangerous conditions, sometimes under fire. Thus the wooden ships of the time were constantly in need of caulkers, whether to build them in the dockyards or to form an essential part of their crew, keeping them repaired and waterproof during their long voyages worldwide for both naval and commercial purposes. \nThe portrait (still in the hands of Ben’s direct descendants) shows a young Ben in uniform and an inscription on the back says that it was painted in Canton in 1820. Whether Ben is wearing a naval or an East India Company uniform is not clear from the picture. If he did join the navy, perhaps he was influenced by witnessing as a young boy, while still living in Yarmouth, Nelson’s triumphal return to that town in 1800, after his victory at the Battle of the Nile (1798). Nelson famously declared, ‘I am myself a Norfolk man and glory in being so!’ Census and b/m/d records preserved by the family show that Ben continued to be described as a caulker into quite old age.  Whether this means that he continued working in his later years (probably a necessity in the days before pensions) or whether he was just proud of his profession and rank (a caulker was a senior petty officer) is not known.  The census of 1861 has him living with his family at “The Swan”, 69 Brunswick Street. The location where “The Swan” was situated has disappeared - much of this area was demolished when the Blackwall Tunnel was built  (opened in 1897) but it would have been situated right up against the East India Dock.  From maps of the time, the road appears to have run up from Poplar High Street, next to Robin Hood Lane, which still exists.  Whether Ben was lodging at the Swan or was the landlord is not known.  Some of his descendants did go on to be publicans – while another son became a cordwainer (shoe maker) and a grandson opened the Blackmore pawnbrokers on Poplar High Street.\nPosted by Margaret Chan, a direct descendant of Ben Blackmore.\n','London'),(723,51.3988,-0.0985014,'Dick Turpin\'s Cottage','1735-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-09-24 17:49:39','2017-09-24 17:49:39','pending','','Dick Turpin is said to have used this cottage, which belonged to his aunt and uncle, as a hideaway in c 1735.

The line ran from West Croydon to Forest Hill.  Pumping stations were established at West Croydon, Portland Road (now Norwood Junction) and Dartmouth Road (Forest Hill). Steam engines at these pumping stations created a vacuum in a pipe laid between the rails. A free piston in the pipe was attached to the train through a slit sealed by a leather flap. The piston, with train attached, was pushed from one pumping station to the next by atmospheric pressure. \n\nUnfortunately the atmospheric railway did not prove a success: the air pressure was not able to be maintained and there are contemporary accounts of passengers having to get out and push the trains – sometimes pushing so hard that the train ran off at great speed and they were unable to re-board! The main problem was with the valve flaps which were leaky – in part due to rats developing a taste for the tallow which was used to maintain the seal. The experiment was abandoned in 1846/7 but local legend says that one of the engines still exists and is walled up in a tunnel. Part of one of the 15 inch atmospheric pipes is on show at the Croydon Museum, together with a wind-up model of the railway.\n\nThis picture shows the pumping station at Portland Road, South Norwood. It was next to the station then called The Jolly Sailor station (named after the Jolly Sailor Inn). The pumping station was built in high Gothic style, and had a prominent tower which was both a chimney and a vent for air pumped from the tube.  In 1846 the station was renamed Norwood Station, and by 1856 it had become Norwood Junction.\n\nThe Jolly Sailor Inn (High Street, South Norwood) was rebuilt in the 1860s and renamed the Jolly Sailor public house. Its name refers to the fact it had been built near to the Croydon canal (1809 – 1836) the \'Jolly Sailor\' in question being a bargee. It was also a known haunt of smugglers.  \n\nBy not credited - Illustration in \"The Pictorial Times\", Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1892927\n\nPosted by Margaret Chan (Croydon U3A Local History group)\n\n\n\n','London'),(739,51.3951,-0.0679779,'Blue Plaque for atmospheric Railway','1845-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-09-27 14:40:35','2017-09-27 14:40:35','pending','','Blue Plaque showing the location of the former pumping station for the atmospheric railway which was situated in South Norwood.','London'),(740,51.3746,-0.075016,'Heron\'s Croft, Addiscombe Road','1600-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-09-27 15:21:43','2017-09-27 15:21:43','pending','','Heron\'s Croft is a Grade II listed building on Addiscombe Road which is thought to date from about 17th century (ref Heritage Gateway) or possibly earlier and to be the oldest continually inhabited building in Croydon.\nAddiscombe was originally one of the seven boroughs of Croydon.

The canal had a reservoir at Norwood which still exists and is now known as South Norwood Lake. \n\nThe   Croydon Canal was opened in 1809 and closed in 1836. It ran between the Grand Surrey Canal at Deptford and West Croydon – terminating at what is now West Croydon station.\n\nThere is a very detailed account of the Croydon Canal in Priestley\'s \'Navigable Rivers and Canals\' of 1831 (reprinted by David and Charles 1969). This is includes in Appendix 1:  ‘This canal commences in the Grand Surrey Canal, about three quarters of a mile west from Deptford Dock Yard; from whence its course is southerly, crossing the London and Greenwich Road near New Cross, and shortly afterwards enters Kent, whence it passes Brockley, Sydenham, and re-enters Surrey, on the east side of Penge Common, over which it passes in a direct course, to its termination at Croydon, where there is a convenient wharf and basin. Its length is nine miles and a half; in the first of which it rises 70 feet, by twelve locks; from whence, it continues level something more than three quarters of a mile, where another series of locks, terminating at the entrance into Forest Wood, and rising 79½ feet in the space of three quarters of a mile, conducts to its summit level, which is seven miles in length.’\n\nBy 1811, 22 barges plied the canal. A military survey of that year gave the main goods transported up the canal from the Thames towards Croydon as: \'coals, corn, fir timber, groceries, stone, slate, malt and manure\'. Goods going down the canal from Croydon towards the Thames were: \'oak, elm timber, firestone, lime, fuller’s earth, flints, flour and seeds\'.\n\nThe barges were 60 feet (18 m) long and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide and could carry about 30 tons. They were limited to such small loads because of the shallow depth of the canal - maintaining an adequate  water supply proving a problem for the canal builders from the outset.  The barges did not have living accommodation as bargees could complete their journey backwards or forwards between Deptford and Croydon in one day. \n\nThe canal was  beset with problems from the beginning and was never able to attract the volume of traffic it required to be profitable.  Issues included the fact that: the canal could only accommodate barges carrying  small loads;  the 28 locks were costly to maintain and caused “traffic jams” for the barges waiting to clear them; it was difficult to guarantee the water level of the canal due to the requirements for water of the water mills on the rivers Wandle and Ravensbourne. It was to address this last issue that the canal needed reservoirs..\n\nPerhaps crucially, by the time Croydon\'s canal opened in 1809, the heyday of canals was already over - the steam railway, an alternative, more profitable, form of transport was about to be available. In the vicinity of Croydon, there was already a horse-drawn freight railway system operating  (The Iron Railway) and just a short while after the canal was opened, the steam railway arrived. The canal system was then to be seen as too slow and too old-fashioned and the faster, modern railway transport system was preferred.\n  \nIn 1834 the London & Croydon Railway Company started negotiations to purchase the land and assets of the canal. On 22 August 1836, the Croydon Canal closed and the railway line from London to Croydon was built, generally following the route of the canal.  The railway opened in June 1839, and is the second oldest passenger line in London. \n\nAlthough most evidence of the canal has long disappeared, it is still possible to find traces, if one knows where to look…One of these traces is the South Norwood Lake.\n\nFrom the beginning of its history, the Croydon Canal and its reservoirs were  much used by local people and day-trippers for amusement and relaxation. In 1878, an elderly Sydenham resident described his memories of the canal: “My brothers, myself and others often used to hire a boat at Doo’s Wharf, situated near the [Sydenham] bridge, and row either to Croydon, or the other way to the first lock [near Honor Oak Park station]… occasionally we had a picnic in Penge wood… listening to the nightingales… There was a large reservoir occupying the site of Sydenham Park… much used by the young men of the neighbourhood for bathing in summer and skating in winter”.\n\nThe Croydon Canal passed through some beautiful countryside  - a contemporary article in The Times talks about the travellers on the barges ‘finding themselves gliding through the deepest recesses of the forest, where nothing met the eye but the elegant windings of the clear and still canal, its borders adorned by a profusion of trees of which the beauty was heightened by the tints of autumn.’ Because of this, the canal and its reservoirs quickly became a leisure and tourist attraction and were popular with anglers, boating parties – and in the winter months with skaters.  It also led to the growth of different types of businesses along the canal banks, which catered for the visitors, as well as for the bargees.  These included pubs with tea gardens, such as the Jolly Sailor at Norwood, the Dartmouth Arms at Forest Hill and the Greyhound at Sydenham.\n\nSince the closure of the canal, South Norwood Lake, (originally larger towards the south west end) has continued to be a popular recreational facility. Incidentally, the village of Norwood was built around the canal and the present arrangement of streets in the area reflects the way the canal formed a lengthy loop at this point.\n\nPicture: Croydon Canal at \'Norwood\' – \nCrop from Scharf\'s \'Croydon Canal at Norwood\' 1828 published on ebay\n\nPosted by Margaret Chan (Croydon U3A Local History Group)\n\n\n\n','London'),(744,51.4078,-0.0753164,'South Norwood Lake','2014-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-09-28 10:45:56','2017-09-28 10:45:56','pending','','South Norwood Lake is set in a park of 11.5 hectares.

The fare was a not inexpensive two shillings.

The coal ship’s skipper, Captain Harrison, accompanied by an experienced river pilot, was following traditional Thames routes rather than obeying the new portside-to-portside regulations of 1872. When the boats became dangerously close to each other, what followed was a classic chain of misinterpreting what the other party was attempting to do, until a collision became inevitable. Despite her engines running in full reverse, Bywell Castle struck Princess Alice on the starboard side with such force that the pleasure steamer split in two and began to sink rapidly.\nBywell Castle did its best to rescue survivors, assisted by vessels scrambled from the shore.

Known as ‘Poplar with Blackwall’, the village was one of the Tower Hamlets and the area had thriving ship-building and repair yards from as early as the reign of Henry VIII. In 1614, the Honourable East India Company opened its main shipyard in Blackwall. However it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that real wealth came into the area, with the opening of the West India Dock in 1800 and the East India Dock 1806. The Docks were built to receive cargo-ships, and avoid the heavy taxes levied on cargoes coming into the Pool of London. At the same time, transport links into London were opened up, with the cutting through of the Commercial Road and the East India Dock Road. Although the building work involved the destruction of dwellings and brought great hardship to the residents of the area, it also brought employment opportunities and the population expanded fast – reaching some 43,000 by the middle of the 19th century. With wealthy merchants now attracted into the area, Poplar was upwardly mobile, and in 1817 was created a Parish in its own right. All Saints church was built as the parish church and was consecrated in 1823. It was designed by Charles Hollis and built by Thomas Morris from granite and Portland stone. The church found itself serving a very different Parish after 1866, when the ship-building yards started to close following the collapse of some of London’s Investment Banks. The richer sections of Poplar’s community soon began to move out and the church, under its Rector, Revd Thomas Nowell, responded to local need in an impoverished neighbourhood. His work is honoured in a plaque in the church. The church was damaged by V2 rocket during the Second World War, when the crypt was used as an air-raid shelter, but has been repaired and continues to serve its community.\n','London'),(806,51.5105,-0.0116944,'All Saints churchyard','1823-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-11-02 08:41:27','2017-11-02 14:43:47','pending','','All Saints church is surrounded by a garden.

At the same time as the church was built (1820s) Montague Place (residential)  and Newby Place (residential and civic buildings) were developed, while a terrace of houses in  Bow Lane (now Bazeley Street) was built in the 1840s. Several of the original attractive Georgian houses still exist and some can be seen in this photograph through the railings. The church and the remaining houses now form part of a Conservation Area.

Among the original documentation (in the church archives) listing the rights and responsibilities of the new parish, is to be found the statement that: “the Rector retains the right to close off the East India Dock Road to prevent noise during the time of Divine Service.”\nThe patron of the new Poplar Parish was Brasenose College (Oxford) which was also the patron of Stepney Parish.

Evelyn was an expert on trees and in 1664 he published a very influential treatise on forestry: \"Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty\'s Dominions\". In the park there still stands an ancient mulberry tree which is said by some to have been planted by Evelyn. Although now in very poor condition, it continues to bear fruit.\nThere is a story that the tree was given to Evelyn by Peter the Great (1672 – 1725), Tsar of All Russia from 1682 – 1725.  Peter came to Deptford in 1698 to learn about British ship-building techniques as part of his initiative to modernise Russia. Peter stayed at Sayes Court and proved to be a rowdy and undisciplined young man – he vandalised both house and garden and after he left, Evelyn sought and was granted compensation from the British government for the damage Peter had caused. Whether the tree was Peter’s attempt at an apology is not known.\nIn fact there were mulberry trees in the gardens even before Evelyn took up residence – so this tree might be a descendant of these or of one planted by Evelyn himself. It could indeed have been actually planted by Evelyn - mulberries can live for several hundred years, and there is one at Charlton House, which dates from 1608. Many of the ancient mulberry trees that can be found around London are survivors from, or descendants of, the mulberry trees planted in the early 17th century at the behest of James I, who wished to start a silk industry in England to rival those of France and Italy and imported some 1,000 mulberry saplings for this purpose.\nThere is an interesting link between Sayes Court and Addiscombe Place in Croydon. In 1700, the Addiscombe estate, on the Shirley Road (now the Addiscombe Road), which had been owned by the Heron family from the Tudor period, was bought by William Draper, son-in-law of  Sir John Evelyn. William demolished the old Elizabethan mansion and in 1702 built a new Palladian style mansion, “Addiscombe Place”.Sir John Evelyn recorded in his diary \"I went to Adscomb on 11 July 1703 to see my son-in-law’s new house. It has excellent brickwork and Portland stone features, that I pronounced it good solid architecture, and one of the very best gentlemen\'s houses in Surrey.\"  \nAddiscombe Place later became the Addiscombe Academy, used  to train officers, especially Engineers and Artillery, for the East India Company\'s  Indian regiments. The mansion was finally demolished in the 1860s and the land was developed for housing.\nOne of the roads on the estate is called Mulberry Lane, the name recalling an ancient mulberry tree which stood there but which was sadly cut down when the houses were built. It is sometimes said that this mulberry tree was also a gift from Peter the Great – and although it seems unlikely that it would have been a direct gift from him, it could well have been given to William Draper by his father-in-law, John Evelyn who had perhaps received it from Tsar Peter.\n','London'),(809,51.5013,-0.00869036,'Preston\'s Road Swing bridge ','1870-01-01 00:00:00',NULL,123,'2017-11-06 07:32:14','2017-11-10 08:44:01','pending','','My mother was born in Poplar in 1910 and, like her siblings and her mother, aunts and uncles before her, she attended George Green School, which was then sited on the East India Dock Road.

Their construction was financed by the West India Dock Company, the eventual cost of which came to over one million pounds. The docks, designed by William Jessop, consisted of an import and export dock, comprising 54 acres between them, at the northern end of the Isle of Dogs. Five-storey warehouses lined the docks, cranes were utilized for loading and unloading, and the entire complex was walled in and policed by a private security force. Having been built two miles distant from the historic City, new roads were built to transport imported goods to London. Initially, the docks were very profitable; however, they subsequently faced stiff commercial completion from newer, larger docks, such as the Royal Docks, which greatly affected their profitability. In 1889, the dockers working at the West India Docks were the first to go on strike in what became a city-wide dockworkers strike, one factor which contributed to the purchase of The West India Dock Company by the St Katherine Docks in the same year. This made little difference to the fortunes of the docks, however, and business continued to decline, mostly because large twentieth-century preferred to unload at larger docks in deeper waters. The northern part of the Docks, like much of East London, was bombed heavily during the Blitz and, soon after the War, all business ceased. Recently, however, the Docks have enjoyed a renaissance and now find themselves at the heart of Canary Wharf, London’s new financial center, and the once-decaying warehouses which survived, have now been restored and are home to bars, apartments, offices, shops and the Museum of London in Docklands.\n\nBibliography\n\nInwood, Stephen.

Commissioned as a terminus for railway lines running to the Midlands, construction of the station began in 1864 and was completed by October 1868. The station was designed by the civil engineer William Henry Barlow (1812-1902). Construction of the Midland Grand Hotel adjacent to the station (1865-1873) followed an architectural competition won by George Gilbert Scott. Both the hotel and the train station speak to the emergence of an increasingly mobile Victorian society. Scott was the most successful architect of the Victorian gothic-revival school. Inspired by the high gothic French style, he had studied gothic cathedrals and parochial churches, the influence of which can be seen on some of his other most remarkable designs, including the Albert Memorial and the church of St. Giles Camberwell. Indeed, the Albert Memorial and the Midland Grand Hotel both evidence the Victorian love of colour in their architecture. The hotel at St Pancras station is a magnificent piece of gothic-revival architecture with pointed arches, ribbed stone vaults of pointed profile, and flying buttresses. The station suffered and survived the first two world wars, although it was seriously damaged by enemy action in 1941. A greater threat to its survival came in 1966, when a proposal to demolish both St. Pancras and King’s Cross stations was presented by British Rail. Public opposition ensured its survival thanks to its national value and architectural importance. More recently both station and hotel have been restored to their former glory and the station is now a terminus for national trains running both north and south of London, as well as international trains serving destinations in Europe. St Pancras was a saint whose name meant the one that holds everything, something which well reflects the enormous practical and communal value that the station bearing his name holds today.\n','London'),(823,51.501,-0.123929,'Thomas Thorneycroft’s Statute of Boudicca, Westminster','1856-01-01 00:00:00','1902-01-01 00:00:00',138,'2017-12-05 11:54:41','2017-12-05 11:54:41','pending','http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/boudica/boudicastatue.html','The bronze statue of Boudicca (c.30-61 AD) was commissioned of Thomas Thornycroft by Prince Albert. Its construction turned into one of the longest-running sagas of the Victorian age, taking almost fifty years from commission (1856) to completion (1902). Boudicca was the wife of Prasutagus, king of the Iceni tribe, with whom the Romans had formed an alliance. As such, Boudicca is often thought of as the ‘Celtic Queen’ but all of these terms such as tribe, king, and queen have very different meanings in the modern age and should be used with care. Moreover, evidence for her life is scanty so one has to use Tacitus, the main primary source, very carefully indeed.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, it is clear that the statue was intended to commemorate Boudicca’s rebellion against the Romans who, according to Tacitus, had broken their alliance with the Iceni people. As such, the statue portrays Boudicca as a strong female leader, alongside her two wronged daughters, whom Boudicca is protecting much as she was would her people. It is noticeable that the horses pulling the chariot are not controlled by reins; presumably, Boudicca could steer the chariot as she could her people: through sheer force of will. \nIn fact, the statue tells us more about contemporary attitudes towards Queen Victoria than it does Boudicca, both of whose names supposedly carried the same meaning. One can see some of Victoria’s likeness is in the face of Boudicca and the inscription at the foot of the statue makes it clear that this is a celebration of British imperial glory. Taken from \"Boudicea: An Ode\" by William Cowper (1782), it reminds the reader that \"regions Caesar never knew, thy posterity shall sway.\"\nThe statue enigmatically stands facing Parliament, perhaps as a warning as if to say \"the Crown is watching.\"\n','London'),(824,51.4606,-0.0720549,'Dulwich Public Baths: London’s oldest public baths in continuous operation','1891-06-24 23:00:00',NULL,151,'2017-12-05 16:40:29','2017-12-05 16:40:29','pending','','Dulwich Public Baths, now known as the Dulwich Leisure Center, is London\'s oldest public bath still in continuous operation.

According to subsequent records from their Old Bailey trial, Bishop and Williams frequented The Bird Cage often, and they were identified by witnesses from the pub as the men who had carried Ferrier’s body out of their home in a sack.\nIn November 1831, Bishop, Williams and May were arrested and subsequently tried for the murder of Ferrier. Although he did not confess to the murder, Bishop did confess to stealing 500-1,000 bodies over a span of twelve years. Found guilty of murder, Bishop and Williams were executed outside Newgate Gaol on 5 December 1831, reportedly in front of a crowd of 30,000 people. Bishop and Williams may have found it rather fitting that their bodies were given to two institutions for dissection. The London Burkers’ case, resulted in increased concern over the prevalence of murder and bodysnatching to compensate for the lack of corpses available for anatomists. This is why, in part at least, the London Burkers are responsible for the 1832 Anatomy Act, which aimed to reduce the need for illegally obtained bodies by permitting anatomists to dissect any body that went unclaimed by friends or family for private burial.','London'),(826,51.5194,-0.126879,'The British Museum Reading Room 1857-1997','1857-01-01 05:00:00',NULL,131,'2017-12-13 00:44:49','2017-12-13 00:44:49','pending','','The Reading Room at the British Museum stood as a hallmark of intellectualism in the history of London from its opening in 1857 to its closure following the opening of the British Library in 1997. The ideas for the room’s design came first from Sir Anthony Panizzi, who held several posts at the British Museum between 1831 and 1866, the most important of which was that of Principal Librarian which he held from 1856 onwards. It was built, however, by architect Sidney Smirke, who worked on bringing Panizzi’s sketches and ideas into vivid reality, within the magnificent British Museum designed by his brother Sir Robert Smirke. The interior features a highly-coloured and decorated dome, and multiple shelves of books and texts, which were needed to hold the museum’s rapidly increasing collection. Indeed, thanks to Panizzi’s remarkable efforts as Principal Librarian and Keeper of Printed Books, the museum’s collection expanded to 600,000 books, and his influence continued to be felt after his retirement as his successors oversaw a further increase in the collection to over a million texts by 1888. The labyrinth of book stacks referred as the ‘iron library’ held these texts, although not all of them were available to the general public. Access to the reading room was granted by the production of a written character recommendation from a respectable community figure. The Reading Room was the haunt of many great literary, political, and scholarly figures. Some of its most notable visitors were: Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Eleanor Marx, Thomas Hardy, G K Chesterton, George Orwell, V S Naipaul, Rudyard Kipling, and many more. Despite it being recognized as one of the most impressive sights in London, the room is currently not available for viewing, photography, or filming and has been closed for a decade.','London'),(827,51.4974,-0.0540733,'Octavia Hill Southwark Cottages','1895-01-01 05:00:00',NULL,154,'2017-12-17 18:46:04','2017-12-17 18:46:04','pending','http://www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk/octavia-hill-borough/4587855679','Red Cross Cottages and Garden are among the finest surviving examples of steps taken in the nineteenth century by the so-called ‘five per cent philanthropists’ to alleviate poor quality and overcrowded housing for the working classes in London. Designed by Elijah Hoole, the cottages incorporated Octavia Hill’s love of “quaint irregularity” in their Tudor-influenced design. Octavia Hill was a tireless reformer who believed in a holistic approach to the problems facing many of London’s Victorian poor; to her moral reform and education went hand in hand with housing reform. Hill employed workers to visit tenants in her properties in order to help with home improvement, cleaning and financial management; for example, one non-negotiable aspect of life for Hill’s tenants was the weekly rent demand. The cottages were built between 1884 and 1887 on land given to Hill by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and her philosophy of housing reform is reflected in the design of these cottages. On the site is a small garden for the residents and a hall which became the community’s focus and served as a meeting place for a working man’s club, a band and an army cadet corps. Southwark Council paid for the re-installation of a bandstand in 2014, the paving of which is now engraved with the motivational message ‘Do noble deeds, not dream them’, which was Hill’s motto. While cottages of this type and on this scale could not solve the issues of overcrowding in Victorian London, they did influence subsequent practice and changed the lives of those fortunate enough to call them home.','London'),(828,51.6071,-0.121751,'George Dimmock, First World War conscientious objector, 2 Herbert Road, Bowes Park, Wood Green, Haringey','1916-02-29 00:00:00',NULL,75,'2017-12-21 14:22:02','2017-12-21 14:30:14','pending','https://hfwwpf.wordpress.com','George Dimmock, 1894-19?, one of 12 children, assistant manager and roundsman for a wine and spirit merchant.

Designed by Spalding & Cross, the Dulwich Public Baths was an immediate success: on 16 July 1892, The South London Press, a local newspaper reported that “during the week ended July 9, 4,291 bathers visited the baths where the warm private baths are now open. The first-class bath is now filled from the 30-inch main, and the water is all that can be desired—quite clear and clean.”\nThe Baths were temporarily repurposed during both world wars. In the First World War they were used by local hospitals and the Red Cross; additionally, the Baths housed refugees and troops, and were occasionally used as an unofficial shelter during numerous air raids. In preparation for World War II, the baths were closed for public access and repurposed in 1938–39. These war preparations included the boarding of both swimming pools for medical supplies and first aid. In 1940 the pools were again planned to close for the winter, but were kept open and full for use by the Auxiliary Fire Service, for use when dealing with fire from air raid damage. \n','London'),(834,51.6083,0.0990486,'St. Peter\'s Italian Church-Holburn','2017-01-01 05:00:00',NULL,147,'2018-01-04 21:47:13','2018-01-04 21:47:13','pending','http://italianchurch.org.uk/','St. Peter\'s Italian Church is one of the oldest Roman-Catholic churches in London and the first to cater to the influx of Italian immigrants during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The last lodger was a carpenter, who had sunk a saw-pit at the north end of the courtyard. The whole front of the house, which had originally formed three sides of a square, was of carved oak. The tradition was that the cats\' heads carved on the ceilings always had their eyes directed on the spectator wherever he stood, and that even the knockers had once been shaped like cats\' heads. Two sides of the outer square were nearly all glass lattice, and above and below ran wild-beasts\' heads and crouched goblins, that acted as corbels. The doorway panels were richly carved, and above and below each tier of windows were strings of carved shields, including several arms of the City companies. \"\nOld and New London: Volume 2.
